            The line compensation code may increase print volume noticeably.
            During testing, it has allowed Hangprinter version 2 to go places
            where version 1 surely would have over-tightened lines and skipped steps.

               Hangprinter version 2 at X=0, Y=-600 mm, Z=600 mm.
               Securing anchor points with tape and weights works only as long as no lines over tighten.
               During force testing, the motors easily ripped loose the weighed- and taped down anchor points without missing steps.
               Forces on the lower left anchor point due to gravity in this picture is ca 15 N along the direction of the lines.
                   Vertical force from the weights is also about 15 N, so the tape (under the weights) is necessary to keep the anchor point
               in place.
                   The kitchen bench is always this clean.

                 Since the worm driven D-axis is so strong,
                 and because line buildup compensation reduces the risk of over tightening,
                 we can work with more extreme angles than before.

         <div class="date">11-12-2016</div>
         <p>
              I've added to Hangprinter-Marlins some code that
              compensates for line buildup on the spools.
              Without it, I found that error in steps/mm grew to several percent
              as print dimensions grew close to 1 m.
              The problem was particularly noticeable on the D-axis since it has three doubled lines,
              so moving 1 mm in the D-direction puts 6 mm of line on the D-spool.
            
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                   The D-spool in this figure has ca 15 m of 0.39 mm thick line wound around it.
                   This gives the D-axis a movement range of 15/6 = 2.5 m.
                   Without compensation, and if the line was winded in a perfectly compact manner, this would give a 5.5 % error in steps/mm
               in the depicted position.
                   As we see in the picture, windings are rather unevenly distributed along the spool's height.
                   The error is therefore somewhat higher than 5.5 %.
                   Hangprinter-Marlin currently approximates the cross-section of the line to be rectangular rather than circular.
                   It therefore approximates the error to be 7 % instead of 5.5 %.
                   My preliminary tests suggest that the experienced error is closer to 10 %.

              Setting these variables will require some measuring and messing around in <code>Configuration.h</code>.
              The comments in <code>Configuration.h</code> are honestly trying to be helpful.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              The above equation requires quite a bit of computation.
              If an Atmega2560 running Hangprinter-Marlin were to perform it more frequently than ~10 times per second,
              it would risk computing new movements slower than it performed them, leading to unwanted print pauses and jerky movements.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              To limit the computational load Hangprint-Marlin is currently only computing new steps/mm once per received G1 or G92 commands.
              A gcode file with 300 G1 movements would cause Hangprinter-Marlin to compute new steps/mm 300 times.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Computing steps/mm only once per movement is of course an approximation.
              We will only get steps/mm right at exactly one point along the G1-move.
              It is tempting to place this point at one of the ends since that would be computationally cheap.
              However, it would kill precision, even for simple movements like the following
            
         </p><pre><code>
  G92 X0
  G1 X100
  G1 X0
  </code></pre><p>
              The printer would use different steps/mm settings for the two different G1-moves.
              It would not end up where it started.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Instead of correctness at endpoints, Hangprinter-Marlin computes steps/mm to be correct at the middle of every G1 move.
              This solves the trivial example of back-and-forth movement described above, but it is still an approximation.
              The next theoretical step will be to find an equation describing the error we accumulate from not
              continuously computing new values for steps/mm.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              If you want to improve the approach to dynamic steps/mm I've described above,
              then you will most probably want to improve lines 1757 to 1763 in <code>Marlin_main.cpp</code>:

                   When measuring <code>C_Z</code>, the dangling Hangprinter is hard to fixate, and the point where
                   <code>ANCHOR_C_Y</code> and <code>ANCHOR_C_X</code> meet is hard to determine.

         <h3>Step 0: Mount Wall Frame Parts</h3>
         <p>
              Mount all the lower frame parts at roughly equal heights above your floor.
              While not theoretically necessary, this makes calculations and measurement procedures easier.
              We assume your floor is perpendicular to gravity.

         <p>
              Keep the flat sides of lower frame parts as parallel to the ceiling frame part's sides as you can.

         <h3>Step 1: Mark out Origo in XY-Plane</h3>
         <p>
              Use tape or ink to mark out a point directly below your ceiling frame part.
              This point will be used for measurement and homing reference, so keep it fixed and visible.

         </figure>
         <h3>Step 3: Translate to Cartesian Distances</h3>
         <p>
              Now that we use our six measurements to determine six unknowns.
              Denoting the x-position of anchor point <code>B</code> like <code>B_x</code>, we can list the unknowns:
            
         </p>
         <ul>
              
            <li><code>A_y</code></li>
              
            <li><code>B_y</code></li>
              
            <li><code>B_x</code></li>
              
            <li><code>C_y</code></li>
              
            <li><code>C_x</code></li>
              
            <li><code>D_z</code></li>
            
         </ul>
         <p>
              We orient our Cartesian coordinate system such that <code>A_x = 0</code>.
              Also, we set <code>A_z = B_z = C_z = 0</code> from the restrictions in step 0 above.
              Now the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines">Law of cosines</a>
                and good old Pythagoras solves the rest for us.
            
         </p>
         <ul>
              
            <li><code>A_y = -a</code></li>
              
            <li><code>B_y = (s^2 - b^2 - a^2)/(2*a)</code></li>
              
            <li><code>B_x =  sqrt(s^2 - (a + B_y)^2)</code></li>
              
            <li><code>C_y = (f^2 - c^2 - a^2)/(2*a)</code></li>
              
            <li><code>C_x = -sqrt(f^2 - (a + C_y)^2)</code></li>
              
            <li><code>D_z = d</code></li>
            
         </ul>
         <h3>Step 4: Take Action Point Offsets Into Account</h3>
         <p>
              Since lines are not tied to the center of hangprinter we need to subtract the offsets.
              These numbers are more or less hard-coded into the
              <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/tree/calibration_manual_0">OpenSCAD files</a>.
              I made a branch called <code>calibration_manual_0</code>
              that corresponds to the renderings in this post.
              I'm also listing the values for ya right here. Yeah, right here:
            
         </p>
         <ul>
              
            <li><code>ANCHOR_A_X = 0</code></li>
              
            <li><code>ANCHOR_A_Y = -(a - 59.8)</code></li>
              
            <li><code>ANCHOR_A_Z = -146.4</code></li>
              
            <li><code>ANCHOR_B_X = B_x - 59.8*sqrt(3)/2</code></li>
              
            <li><code>ANCHOR_B_Y = B_y - 59.8/2</code></li>
              
            <li><code>ANCHOR_B_Z = -136.6</code></li>
              
            <li><code>ANCHOR_C_X = C_x + 59.8*sqrt(3)/2</code></li>
              
            <li><code>ANCHOR_C_Y = C_y - 59.8/2</code></li>
              
            <li><code>ANCHOR_C_Z = -126.8</code></li>
              
            <li><code>ANCHOR_D_X = 0</code></li>
              
            <li><code>ANCHOR_D_Y = 0</code></li>
              
            <li><code>ANCHOR_D_Z = d - 117.0</code></li>
            
         </ul>
         <p>
              These values correspond exactly to what you're supposed to feed into <code>Configuration.h</code>
                to calibrate your Hangprinter.
            
         </p>
         <h3>In Theory...</h3>
         <p>
              We could add three more measurements and be able to calculate <code>A_z</code>, <code>B_z</code> and <code>C_z</code>.
              This would get rid of the requirement to mount the lower anchor points in a plane perpendicular to gravity.
              I find these three measurements a bit difficult to carry out in practice.
              Practical difficulty is of course subjective, but the six-measurement procedure is the one I use.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              I hope this has been useful, best of luck!

         <div class="date">23-9-2016</div>
         <p>
              I've thought some more about Hangprinter recently, since I'm going to demonstrate it on the
              <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1052788231502429/">3d printer festival</a>
              arranged by the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology in Oslo.
              I've only ever mounted and calibrated Hangprinter once before,
                so getting the manual homing to work fast enough worries me a bit.
              I don't have the time to implement the proposed
              <a href="http://www.appropedia.org/Clerck,_a_RepRap_3D_printer_hanging_from_the_ceiling#Home_position">accelerometer dependent homing procedure</a>
              before the festival.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              The following (almost stupidly simple but still kind of useful) solution will be the first thing I try to make homing faster
              than the aiming plump technique I've used before (see <a href="https://vitana.se/opr3d/tbear/bilder/center_lod.JPG">picture</a>).
            
         </p>

                 </a>
              
            <figcaption>
                   It should be precise enough to home a Hangprinter by aligning five marks, one on each sandwich gear and one on the bottom
               plate (all green in this illustration).
                   An initial homing calibration using an aiming plumb, to place the green markings correctly, is still needed though.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              If alignment of marks as shown above proves sufficiently precise,
                I will use a similar concept for automatic homing.
              Replacing the green marks with and optical or magnetic sensor arrangement should be quite straightforward.

              I've thought about a second generation Hangprinter lately, including the extruder.
              My current favourite re-design uses two motors running synchronously.

              The motors in the figure above are supposed to resemble Mabuchi 130 servos rather than steppers.
              The informed discussion in
              <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?1,661444">this forum thread</a>
              and
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_5KsAOVko">this video demonstration</a>
              have made me interested in servos again.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              The RepRap community's relationship with servos is long, complicated and rather fruitless
                even though the promise of mechanical simplicity and low weight has always been present.
              There seems to be something hard about servos.
              Still, 2d-printer-engineers manages to churn out servo driven movement platforms, lots of them.
              Are those Inkjet engineers better than us?
              No, of course not.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Anyways, if the servo usage doesn't pan out at all, I can always try two Nema14's instead.
              Pinching filament between two motor shafts would still be cool and simple.
              Not as cool as servos though.

         <div class="date">10-9-2016</div>
         <p>
              RepRappers have noticed me that basing the story line of my
                <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/File:Thesis.pdf">my Master's thesis</a>
              on productivity numbers doesn't resonate with them.
              This tickled me to think about and formulate why I do what I do, hence this post.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              In the thesis, I really wanted to say that we can afford producing in humane, joyful ways, and that D3D-Porteus can help.
              Also, in this title and previous posts, I have used the word "chaotic" loosely.
              With <i>chaotic</i> I mean "distributed between people with their own budgets for time and money".
            
         </p>
         <p>
              In centralized production, unrelatedness, vulnerability and boredom are hidden costs
                because they are hard to count but easy to feel.
              In <i>chaotic production</i>, the producer carries the total production cost, both in time, money and emotion,
                and also decides how to work and when to stop.
              Chaotic production must be <i>optimized</i> to meet the producers interests.
              <i>Optimizing chaotic production</i> must include preserving creative joy.
            
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                    I think balmy moods and good times in general depends on conscious effort
                    even though production is intrinsically satisfying.
                    The words
                    "optimizing chaotic production" describe one way of doing one type of such effort.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              The answer to the question posed in the title is then the inverse of unrelatedness, vulnerability and boredom, namely:
            
         </p>
         <h3>1: Close Relations</h3>
         <p>
              As humans we are evolved to thrive in small groups that help each other.
              Helpers feel pride and helped ones feel gratitude.
              It is hard to help and get love in return from distant factories.
              Producing everything centrally wastes opportunities to feel more pride and gratitude in our lives.
            
         </p>
         <h3>2: Resilience</h3>
         <p>
              Centralized factories are single points of failure.
              Shit just happens sometimes and when it happens we better know how to produce our stuff ourselves.
            
         </p>
         <h3>3: Fun</h3>
         <p>
              We are born capable of having interests and we thrive when we get to follow them.
              Chaotic production doesn't have bosses with the licence to bore.
              When you're allowed to listen to your heart you will recognize its sense of humour.
              If you live in an industrialized society you will probably not end up starving in the streets
                even if you listen to a funny heart.

              Today I asked a <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?1,705311">question on reprap forums</a> that has puzzled me for a long time.
              Why don't we share gcode instead of 3d models?
              The technical obstacles are small and it would be an obvious optimization of chaotic production.
              See <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?1,705311">the forum post</a> for details.
              Hoping for an interesting discussion there.

              Now that my Master's is finished I'll try to make a living out of it.
              I'll continue to post report-like documentation here and list day-to-day activities
              over at <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Tobben_Log">my log on the OSE wiki</a>.

              As a start, I've co-founded a limited company that is offering RepRap Assembly Workshops and other course activity
              to schools and youth clubs around Norway and Sweden. See home page in Norwegian <a href="http://ludvigsen3dprinting.com/">here</a>.
              I tried to make a logo in Blender. It's my first one, and it ended up looking like something you would expect to see on
            a tube of tooth paste,
                but I kind of like it because I made it myself:

              Before I dive into searching far and wide for jobs, I need to work on my RepRap family in Norway and Sweden.
              I need people who know RepRap that I can talk with and share knowledge, experiences, hardware and services with.
              As a start, I'll head to Oslo this week and visit Bitraf and Fellesverkstedet.
              I hope I can get to know them by helping them with their projects.
              If they want to cooperate on one of my projects, I plan on suggesting a new D3D-Porteus based on <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/">GuixSD</a>,
              or to work on portable gcode as described in the forum post I posted today.

                    Output per work hour increased drastically between 1995 and 2010.
                    Only the most positive economists see rising incomes after ca 1998.
                    The productivity increase is largely attributed to better usage of computers, robots, and the Internet within organizations.

              The plots above tell so many stories I, could stare at them for hours.
              I see how the computer age takes off, and robots starts to produce stuff crazy fast while people go furious.
              It's like a very odd movie plot, it makes me scratch my head.
              I've experienced the frustrations of modern western life
                but I'm surprised by the glaring and obvious stagnation and frustration in the above stats.

                   this report</a>'s Figure 4.
              The accompanying text explains western middle class stagnation with globalization.
              It may be right, I don't know what caused what.
              I just think that our computers and robots should have prevented stagnation regardless.
              They are so powerful and even supposed to be personal. END EDIT

              Computers are machines for thought work, they should lift our burden of thought and give us peace of mind.
              Well, at least in theory (my dreams)...
              It would be so nice to just reboot the computer revolution and make it better.
              Computers could make people independent, resilient, and proud if used right.
              Like cars do.

              Many are still inspired by T-Ford's successful production style.
              Bringing a machine to the masses has meant setting up a central production line for at least 100 years,
                including the years of the recent computer revolution.
              Only around 2007 was central production first rivaled, by copyability through self-manufacture.
              The RepRap 3D printers then got so easy to copy, partly thanks to self-manufacturing,
                that the number of producers grew exponentially.

              When rebooting the computer revolution we should try the new RepRap-style of production.
              In the thesis I show that RepRaps are very popular and numerous.
              I also show that they are actually produced and forwarded virally.
              To formalize this observation, I present some data collected by Spanish RepRappers (see Figure 5)
                and import a structural virality measure used by researchers on other viral phenomena.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              In the presentation I point out that chaotic production requires low <i>unique parts count</i>,
                good <i>documentation</i> and low <i>price</i>, just like assembly line production.
              I suggest that <i>software freedom</i> and <i>self-manufacture</i> are additional efficiency requirements not found
                in assembly line production.

              I set out to optimize the chaotic and distributed RepRap production
                and discover that I can do so by optimizing RepRap Assembly Workshops,
                and particularly the software that they use.
              I collect all the data I can find about RepRap Assembly Workshop arrangements on the Internet.

                and I found it handy.
              Technical details of the live OS is another post, but files are hosted

         <div class="date">8-2-2016</div>
         <p>
              I've been working on Open Source Ecology 3D printer workshops (see my <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Tobben_Log">work log</a> for exactly what I've been up to)
              the past month, and will continue to work on that until mid summer.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Clerck would love to be developed further by anyone even if I'm on another project right now.
              The following instructions should not be considered "the ultimate way", it's simply how I did it on my first try with the
            prototype.
              The best absolute source of Clerck information is the OpenSCAD files in the Github repo.
              A special branch was created for this build manual, called
              <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/tree/build_maunal_0">build_maunal_0</a>.
              <code>Hangprinter.scad</code> is the most high-level entry point.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              This build manual will be short and terse.

         <h3>Step 0: Sourcing</h3>
         <p>
              For vitamins bill of materials, see
              <a href="http://www.appropedia.org/Clerck,_a_RepRap_3D_printer_hanging_from_the_ceiling#Costs">the Appropedia article</a>.
              Some info on hardware specifics is found in
              <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/tree/build_maunal_0/used_hardware">used_hardware</a> directory in repo.
              For printed parts bill of materials, search
              <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/tree/build_maunal_0/stl">stl directory</a> of build_maunal_0 branch
              in Github repo for the shown STL files.
              You'll also need the Hangprinter-Marlin firmware.
              It's in the firmware folder of the
              <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/tree/build_maunal_0/firmware/Marlin">repo</a>.

         <h3>Step 1: Cut Lines to Length and Tie to Spools</h3>
         <p>
              Cut all nine lines to desired lengths.
              If you know the distances between the origin (middle of print bed) and the mounting points (walls and ceiling),
                then you can use those to calculate good line lengths.
              I use twice the origin/wall-distance plus ca 1.5 meters along all axes.
              As there are 4 movement axes on this printer, there will be 4 lengths.
              We call them the A-length, B-length, C-length and D-length.
            
         </p>

                    The bottom plate (largest printed part) has A, B, and C inscriptions on it,
                      indicating which side should face which wall-mounted anchor point.

         <p>
              After this step you should have:
            
         </p>
         <ul>
              
            <li>2 A-length lines</li>
              
            <li>2 B-length lines</li>
              
            <li>2 C-length lines</li>
              
            <li>3 D-length lines</li>
            
         </ul>
         <p>
              Tie the A-length lines onto one spool, then the B-length lines onto another spool etc.
            
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                   Use short (6mm?) M3 screws and nuts to assemble all four spools and large gears.
                   Flatness of top or bottom surfaces of geared spools is important.
                   Be sure that no screws or nuts protrude more than ca 0.5 mm.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <h3>Step 3: Sandwich Spools, Gears, Bearings and Spacers onto Bottom Plate</h3>
         <figure>

                   Exploded view of the stack of spools. From the bottom up:
                   608 bearing, geared spool with D-line, spacer, 608 bearing, geared spool with C-line, spacer,
                   608 bearing, geared spool with B-line, spacer, 608 bearing, geared spool with A-line.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              The bearings and spacers should push-fit onto the middle cylinder of the bottom plate.
              Ensure that geared spools rotate freely by rotating and wiggling them by hand.
            
         </p>
         <h3>Step 4: Mount Fish Rod Rings and Stop Screw</h3>

                    The stopper screw and nut that can be used to lock the D-spool manually.
                    Notice the nut trapped in the box.
                    The stop screw works by pushing against the D-spool gear, preventing it from rotating.
                    Use a nyloc nut in the box or remove the stop screw during printing, to avoid that the stop screw
                    vibrates into a stopping position mid-print.
                 
            </figcaption>

         <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Tble-extruder</h3>
         <p>
              I used the E3D Volcano as my hot end.
              Its build instructions are found
              <a href="http://wiki.e3d-online.com/wiki/E3D-v6_%28Volcano%29_Documentation">here</a>.
              You could use any hot end, but big nozzle diameter and long melt area are key for high print speeds.
              The Volcano has worked well for me
                in that it was easy to install, doesn't clog and drools surprisingly little compared to its big nozzle diameters.
            
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                    Note the white PTFE (teflon) tube guiding filament into hot end.
                    The blue 623 bearing needs support along the direction of the screw it's mounted on.
                    I used ca 10 washers for this.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              Be warned that the forthcoming alignment task fiddly.
              If I had any time to work on the Hangprinter project's modules,
                this extruder would be drastically changed to reduce fiddlyness.

            <figcaption>
                    The hex head screw is pushed through a sandwich of
                      large extruder gear, printed part, 623 bearing, hobbed insert, 623 bearing, printed part and finally M3 nut.
                    Some washers and lots of fiddling will be needed to assure feeding hobbs, support bearing and PTFE tube align with each
               other.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <h3>Step 6: Mount Extruder Motor</h3>
         <p>
              The small extruder gear is push-fit onto the extruder motor shaft, which should have one flat side.
              Remove two neighbouring bottom screws from the bottom of the motor before mounting.
            
         </p>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/mounted_extruder_motor.png">

                 </a>
              
            <figcaption>
                    Align the two empty screw holes with the horizontal holes in the bottom plate.
                    Most stepper motors are only threaded in their top piece,
                      so the two leftmost screws in this figure need to be rather long.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              Note that this step is very dependent on motor size (maybe unnecessarily so).
              If you have another motor than 17HS4401N,
                then double check that your motor fits (see lines 2, 3 and 4 in <code>measured_numbers.scad</code>).
              The extruder motor hole is created on
              <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/blob/build_maunal_0/parts.scad#L262">line 262 in <code>parts.scad</code></a>,
              if you rather want to change the CAD file than change the motor.
            
         </p>
         <h3>Step 7: Mount Tble-extruder</h3>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/extruder_mount.png">
                   <img src="./bilder/extruder_mount_liten.png" alt="">

            <figcaption>
                    Place extruder carefully so that gears roll easily, filament hole aligns with hobbed insert
                    and edge is flush with extruder motor screw hole edge.
                    Note that screws here are self-tapping.
                    The distance between the bottom plate and the hobbed insert is a problem when changing filament, so
                      some kind of guiding tube is recommended, but not yet designed...

         <h3>Step 10: Mount Wall and Ceiling Parts</h3>
         <p>
              This is the step where you potentially do screw holes in your walls and ceiling.
              I use strong double-sided tape for all wall-mounted parts.
              Placement is really insensitive as long as all plates are, fixed and horizontal.
              Each side plate should be parallel with one side of the ceiling plate.
            
         </p>

         <h3>Step 11: Thread D-lines</h3>
         <p>
              I rested motors on two towers of books while doing this.

                    Let D-lines run clockwise around spool, thread through fish eyes, vgroove bearings near ceiling and tie to the screw
               head that holds
                    the fish eye.

         <h3>Step 12: Mount electronics</h3>
         <p>
              Secure locking screw on D-spool-gear and flip the printer upside down.
              Mount Arduino Mega+RAMPS on an isolating plastic sheet, and mount that sheet using bottom-screws of stepper motors.
              I used a piece of ice cream packaging as isolation sheet.

         <h3>Step 13: Upload Firmware</h3>
         <p>
              Plug in the USB cable and upload the Marlin firmware found in <code>firmware/Marlin/Marlin</code>.
              If you haven't uploaded firmware through the Arduino IDE before, it looks like shown in
              <a href="https://youtu.be/YM3z9IdLzAk?t=1m">this video</a>.
              Try to communicate with your RAMPS board through USB cable and
              <a href="https://github.com/kliment/Printrun#using-pronterface">Pronterface</a> (no power supply is needed for this).
              Hangprinter-Marlin uses baud rate 115200.
              Unplug USB cable when done.
            
         </p>
         <h3>Step 14: Wire up electronics</h3>
         <p>
              For those who are new to electronics, take some time to read about general electronics safety. For examle
              <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/electronics-safety-rules.html">Electronics Safety Rules for Dummies</a> and
              <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/169994/how-to-protect-your-pcs-hardware-from-static-electricity-when-working-on-it/">howtogeek article on static electricity protection</a>.
              Insulate the hot end. The Clerck design has a high risk of melting its own cables, which will
              cause fire (see <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?392,294850">forum thread</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Mount stepper driver chips and adjust Stepstick trimpots to get the right reference voltage
              (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItYRMLGoVc">Tom's video on this</a> and
              <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/2133">Pololu's product home page</a>).
              I use Stepsticks with drv8825 drivers, extra long legs and cooling ribs both above and below chip
                (see <a href="http://vitana.se/opr3d/tbear/2015.html#stutter">previous stuff</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p>
              If you connected power to RAMPS during reference voltage adjustment, pull the wall-plug and also unplug power connectors
            on RAMPS now.
              Also unplug your USB cable.
              Wire A-motor to RAMPS's X-contacts, B-motor to Y-contacts, C-motor to Z-contacts and D-motor to E1-contacts.
              Wire E-motor and hot end as shown <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS1.4#Wiring">here</a>.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              If you want wirelessness, wire in the JY-MCY bluetooth antennae as described on <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Jy-mcu">the RepRapWiki</a>.
              Note that the antennae connection will prevent communication through USB cable as long as it is plugged in.
              I use Blueman Device Manager 1.23 and a Ubuntu 14.04 system for connecting to the JY-MCU.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              After doing safety-checks on the electronics and power supply with your multimeter,
              flip the printer back into upright position and couple the power chords to the RAMPS board.
              When you're confident that your wiring is right, plug your power supply into the wall and feed your Clerck its first taste
            of 12V.
            
         </p>
         <h3>Step 15: First Movement</h3>
         <p>
              Connect to your Clerck through Pronterface and check that D-motor has a nice constant holding torque.
              Unscrew the D-stop screw and watch Clerck hang by itself.
              While holding a hand below it, try sending the gcode line <code>G3 D-1</code>.
              This tells Clerck to move 1 mm closer to the D anchor point in the ceiling,
                without recording or counting the movement anywhere.
              Also, ensure hot end temperature readings are sane and try to heat it to say 40 degrees Celsius.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Did it move? Did temp level out at 40? Is it still alive? Sweet Victory!
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Now, don't disconnect and reconnect. RAMPS will reset upon reconnection and the D-motor will lose
              its static torque for a moment. This risks letting Clerck smash into the floor.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              The G3-command is very handy for manually homing the printer on startup.
              Clerck doesn't have automatic homing yet.
            
         </p>

                    Where to measure to find the calibration value <code>ANCHOR_A_Y</code> of your Clerck setup.
                    I find careful calibration measurements out in thin air to be the hardest part of a Clerck build.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              See lines 96 (<code>#define ANCHOR_A_X</code>) and onwards in <code>firmware/Marlin/Marlin/Configuration.h</code>.
              Measure lengths from fish eye to line opening in frame parts.
              Arduino IDE can be used to compile and upload Marlin.
              For experimentation with line length configurations, use gcode
              <code>M665 Q&lt;Ax&gt; W&lt;Ay&gt; E&lt;Az&gt; R&lt;Bx&gt; T&lt;By&gt; Y&lt;Bz&gt; U&lt;Cx&gt; I&lt;Cy&gt; O&lt;Cz&gt; P&lt;Dz&gt;</code>.

         <h3>Step 18: Additions to Ceiling Plate</h3>
         <h4>Counterweights</h4>
         <p>
              I use ca 250 grams of counterweight attached in each corner, with lines running along the outermost D-lines and running
            through
              the same vgroove bearings in the ceiling part.
            
         </p>
         <h4>Manual Homing with Aiming Plumb</h4>
         <p>
              I'm simply homing the printer using gcodes <code>G3</code> (move without recording it) after powering on.
              The gcodes <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Gcode#G92:_Set_Position">G92</a> and
              <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Gcode#M114:_Get_Current_Position">M114</a>.
              To help the manual homing process, I've attached an aiming plumb to the center of the ceiling part, see
              <a href="./bilder/center_lod.JPG">picture</a> and <a href="#hangprinter_project_18">previous post</a>.
