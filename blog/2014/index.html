            I was contacted by a silversmith recently, that was in the process of making
            a batch of buttons for some seafarers.
            He gave me this sketch, that the sefarers had given him:
            
         </p>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/knappetegning.png">
                   <img src="./bilder/knappetegning_liten.png" alt="button sketch">
                 </a>
              
            <figcaption>
                   The sketch.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              In addition, I got instructions to put a rope ring around the button
              to protect from the pointy arrows.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              The special challenge for me in this was the scale.
              The button was to be produced with two different diameters: 15 and 20 mm.
              Height: 1 to 3 mm.
              In other words, the details need to be less than 0.33 mm high, and sometimes
              ca 0.3 mm wide.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              First thing I did was to order a 0.3 mm nozzle from Emakershop.
              Second was to make a Git repo which can be found
              <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/silver-button/">here</a>.
              Wish I had more time to describe the process, but a picture of todays prints
              have to do for now.

         <div class="date">6-10-2014</div>
         <p>
              I needed a new sign on our mailbox outside our house recently, so I thought I
              might as well make a two colored plastic sign this time, since the paper ones
              only seems to last for one year or so. If the plastic sign can be used for more
              than 10 years, this project might even be a net time saver.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              I have made models with letters in them several times, and every time I have ended
              up doing it differently. This time, I found a little
              <a href="https://github.com/mtu-most/most-scad-libraries/blob/master/scadfont/font2openscad">Python script</a>,
              called font2openscad, that converted True Type Fonts into OpenScad-importable dxf-files.
              I wanted to use the letters one at a time, so I wrote a little module:
            
         </p>
         <p>
            <pre>
  <code>
module letter(path, trx=0, height = 3){
  translate([trx,0,0])
    linear_extrude(height=height, convexity=10, slices=2) import(path);
}
  </code>
</pre>
            </p>
         <p>
              And then imported just the letters I needed one by one, like this:
            
         </p>
         <p>
            <pre>
  <code>
T = 11.83;
o = 13.77;
r = 11.73;
b = 10.09;
j =  6.73;
oe= 14.94;
module tbear(){
  letter("font/T.dxf",0);
  letter("font/o.dxf",T);
  letter("font/r.dxf",T+o);
  letter("font/b.dxf",T+o+r);
  letter("font/j.dxf",T+o+r+b);
  letter("font/oslash.dxf",T+o+r+b+j);
  letter("font/r.dxf",T+o+r+b+j+oe);
  letter("font/n.dxf",T+o+r+b+j+oe+r);
}
  </code>
</pre>
            </p>
         <p>
              To find reasonable letter-widths (the T+o+...-part) I used what I found in the
              font.scad file created by the font2openscad script.
              Using the letters one by one gave me two advantages
              
            <ul>
                   
               <li>The opportunity to make the sign more beautiful by translating each letter manually. (Extremely time consuming of course.)</li>
                   
               <li>Avoiding OpenScad messing up Scandinavian letters.</li>
                 
            </ul>
              I only exploited the first point only a couple of times as it was too fiddly to be fun.
              The second point, however was a huge win. Every letter in the ttf-file imported gracefully
              without OpenScad ever getting the chance to mess up while encoding/decoding them.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              I am aware that OpenScad has added support for Unicode and that they are adding
              native support for extruding text (look
              <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Using_the_2D_Subsystem#Text">here</a>),
              so the method I'm describing in this blog post is mostly relevant for old OpenScad builds
              like my own.

              The complete script for creating my little mailbox sign can be
              found
              <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/mailbox-sign">here</a>.
              A render of it looks like this:

         <figure>

         </figure>
         <h4> Getting a Two Color Print With One Bowden-fed Print Head And Monochrome Filament</h4>
         <p>
              To get the sign out in two colors, I wanted to pause the print exactly when the last
              rectangular layer was done, before starting on the letters. I wanted this pause, so
              I could change filament manually because I use a rather long Bowden tube.
              I knew I used 0.2 mm z-lift, 0.3 mm layer height and that the rectangular base
              was exactly 1.5 mm thick, so to find the critical moment in the gcode was just a matter of
              searching for <code>G1 Z1.8000</code>. I then inserted directly into the gcode
              commands to
              
            <ul>
                   
               <li>Retract 1 cm filament (G1 F3420.000 E...)</li>
                   
               <li>Make a 2 cm z-lift (G1 Z... F10200.00)</li>
                   
               <li>Pause SD-print (M25)</li>
                   
               <li>Set extruder coordinate to whatever it should be when the manual filament-switch is done and print is resumed (G92 E...).</li>
                 
            </ul>
              (Replace ... with values relative to context in gcode.)
              Throwing in an SD-pause directly into the gcode like this was rather na&iuml;ve, as
              Marlin does some buffer magic so that the pause aren't guaranteed to happen
              at that exact line. In my case, the printer ran two more lines of code before
              pausing. This was no problem however, since I could rewind the print, that is
              reset the file pointer manually with M26 (set SD position).
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Anyway, here's how the end result looked like:

              It's surprising how fun a simple sign can be when I really should be studying ;)

         <div class="date">12-9-2014</div>
         <p>
              I needed to glue together some stls recently, that fit together like the pieces in a puzzle. Like this:

         <p>
              In short, I wanted to snap the right walls together and remove the resulting double internal faces.
              The screendump is from Netfabb Basic,
              but it won't let me "merge selected parts" because I don't have a "pro-licence".
              So I found a tip here
                <a href="http://meshlabstuff.blogspot.se/2009/04/how-to-remove-internal-faces-with.html">here</a>
              that I used with some modifications.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              First, I imported all the meshes into Meshlab and flattened the visible layers. This
              gives me all the parts in a single mesh. I then gave all faces "quality numbers"
              based on how visible they were. This made it possible to select the internal faces
              only and delete them.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              The sequence of Meshlab commands was
              <br>
                <code>Filters -&gt; Mesh Layer -&gt; Flatten Visible Layers</code>
              <br>
                <code>Filters -&gt; Color Creation and Processing -&gt; Ambient Occlusion - Per Face</code>
              <br>
                <code>Filters -&gt; Selection -&gt; Select Faces by Face Quality.</code>
              <br>
            
         </p>
         <p>
              With min=0 and max=0.05 I got this selection:
            
         </p>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/select_faces_by_face_quality.PNG">
                   <img src="./bilder/select_faces_by_face_quality_liten.PNG" alt="Meshlab selection">
                 </a>
              
            <figcaption>
                   The selection I got in Meshlab when searching for the least visible faces.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              If you look closely, you see that some internal faces in my buildings are also selected.
              Those are also unwanted, so getting them selected is like an extra bonus =)
            
         </p>

              That did the trick for me. Hope it does for you to ;)

            I crawled the web after an image of me and a 3d-printer today, to use in an article about the Martine&aring;sen Project in the local
            newspaper. Surprisingly I stubled upon an old video of myself, from another newspaper. You need a paid membership to see it,
            so i put it here.

         <div class="date">8-8-2014</div>
         <h3>The start of it</h3>
         <p>
              I received a call recently, from the Geo-data department of the municipality.
              They were developing some new housing in Martine&aring;sen, and wondered if I could
              print it for them, scale 1:2000. It turned out my dad had tipped them about my
              RepRapping. I printed them a test piece and dad talked me into promising them
              fifteen pieces of landscape prints,
              each of them maximizing the print area of <a href="http://vitana.se/opr3d/doku.php?id=skrivare:gomle">Gomle</a>
              (19 x 19 cm). I thought the project was total madness right from the beginning.
              This would be an order of magnitude bigger than my most complicated print
              thus far, and it was to be done with the most unstable printer I've ever built,
              having access to two old laptops as my only computing power.
            
         </p>
         <h3>Creating a 3D model from contour lines</h3>
         <p>
              I didn't have access to any licenced 3D software what so ever, so I tried various
              free alternatives and started to have some limited success with Google SketchUp.
              I won't go into details here, but it turned out that creating the surface was
              really trivial (although computationally intensive). Looking around in the menus
              I found <i>Draw-&gt;Sandbox-&gt;From Contours</i> which transformed my contour data
              into a surface. Perfect.
            
         </p>

         </figure>
         <p>
              However, to create an stl, you need a watertight model, not just one surface,
              so I needed to build walls and floor myself. Easy peasy was my first thought.
              It took me five working days (well, most of the time I were just waiting for my
              dads poor laptop to finish processing/rendering). I won't go into detail here,
              but the solution involved <i>Simplify contours plugin, Projections plugin,
                   Selection toys</i> and <i>Intersecting surfaces</i>.
              My recommendation is: don't ever try to process large map data files with
              SketchUp and an old laptop. It doesn't work well.

              I managed to get out two pieces, looking roughly the same as the demo print.

              Then lightning struck and destroyed my FTDI-chip! Luckily, I had a new Melzi
              circuit board lying around. I carefully moved all wires from the old Melzi to
              the new Melzi, uploaded firmware to the new board and everything seemed jolly
              good again. Then I suddenly lost contact. I unplugged and replugged the USB, and
              guess what? My laptop processor was suddenly toast! My new circuit board transformed
              my beloved laptop into a sad piece of molten plastic! Some of the following
              debugging is described <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?13,386069">here</a>.
              The mistake was my own. I had not attached the minus side of the 12 V power chord
              tight enough.
            
         </p>
         <h3>Everything just works</h3>
         <p>
              When the hiccups of my new board was ironed out, the following 13 pieces printed
              more or less smoothly. Each peace took ca 12 hours to print, so my dad took the
              time to learn how to make time-lapse videos while waiting. This is the next last
              piece printing:

         <p>
              I've dreamt of a RepRap that uses ceiling and walls its frame for some time now.
              It would use lines and spools instead of smooth rods, belts and linear bearings.
              This blog sort some of my thoughts around it.
            
         </p>
         <h3>The idea</h3>
         <p>
              The printer I dream of would be all in one hanging unit, interfacing with the
              outside world only through filament (direct extrusion), hot end, power chord
              and four lines. Microcontroller, stepper motors and extruder would all sit on the
              hanging unit, so the room in which it operates wouldn't need to add any other
              details than four anchor points.
            
         </p>
         <h3>Benefits</h3>
         <p>
              
            <ul>
                   
               <li>No time spent building frame, except four anchor points.</li>
                   
               <li>Large print volumes.</li>
                   
               <li>Would require no desktop when idle, if it could retract itself up close to the ceiling.</li>
                   
               <li>Cheap.</li>
                   
               <li>Few parts.</li>
                 
            </ul>
            
         </p>
         <h3>Difficulties</h3>
         <p>
              
            <ul>
                   
               <li>Make firmware compensate for the unusual geometry.</li>
                   
               <li>Avoiding rotations.</li>
                   
               <li>Making anchor points.</li>
                 
            </ul>
            
         </p>
         <p>
              The unusual geometry isn't actually that tricky to compensate for. We have four
              lines, so every point in the print volume will have a corresponding tuple of
              four line lengths. Converting from Cartesian xyz-coordinates to these tuples
              of four line lengths is just a matter of using Pythagoras' theorem.
            
         </p>

            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              The issue of avoiding rotations is the one I fear the most. Maybe it is necessary
              to hang the printer in 3 lines from the ceiling, and use 2 parallel lines to each
              of the remaining anchor points, to make the printing unit stable enough. That
              configuration is the one used by brandonheller's
              <a href="http://designmakeshare.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/introducing-skydelta/">SkyDelta</a>.
              The SkyDelta is by the way proof that a hot end can be given stable movement,
              only by using lines.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Making anchor points is maybe the biggest no-selling argument for this type
              of printer that I can see. While anchor points saves the desktop space, and
              makes it possible for people in small apartments to have a dangling printer,
              I suspect that many don't want to/can't screw that many holes in walls and
              ceiling.

                   I suspect while not having to worry about rotations.

         <div class="date">22-4-2014</div>
         <p>
              Made a second attempt at printing the Grue figure from the (really cool)
              <a href="http://teslagrad.com/">Teslagrad game</a>. My last attempt was documented
              <a href="#grue_take1">here</a>.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              This time around, I decided to go for splitting the figure in several
              planes parallel to the xy-plane and the yz-plane, and keep the auto-generated
              support material setting in Slic3r.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              To do the splitting, I used Netfabb Basic's really nice splitting interface. I prefer
              simple, light and open software, so I tried splitting with OpenSCAD and Slic3r first,
              but the file were simply too messy and I didn't manage to repair it. I have to say
              Netfabb is pretty good at handling stls with intersections, holes, flipped normals and
              that kind of stuff. Anyways, here's how the model was split:

              The print took ca 10 hours, glueing it together took ca 30 minutes and removing
              support material never actually finished. Unfortunately, much of the support material was impossible to
              remove, and some of the removed material took with it pieces of the actual figure.

              There are two aesthetic issues with it that really bothers me. First, the
              clued contact surfaces did not fit each other perfectly. The clearly
              visible lines you see in the picture was as good as it could get. I suspect this
              mismatch to be due to a slack in the y-belt. The printer I used was
              <a href="http://vitana.se/opr3d/doku.php?id=skrivare:gomle">the Mendel</a>
              I built for my Mum and Dad last summer, and it hasn't
              really received the love it deserves. The second issue is all the dots of
              support structure that has tainted the figure like warts.
              PLA support structures for PLA figures really sucks. I hope this is the last
              time I try that.

         <div class="date">19-4-2014</div>
         <p>
              Hi there, Internet! The past week, I've gotten some feedback that people (even
              really technically talented ones) don't understand what
              <a href="http://tobbelobb.webfactional.com/print-issue-solution-filter">the web app</a>
              is and what
              it does, so I thought I might try to give an explanation.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              I'm considering renaming it to something like <i>Mini Article Structuring and Searching App</i>
              or something, because there's nothing in the Lisp code that's specific to RepRap.
              The users decide what kind of knowledge is structured with it, but anyway let's use
              RepRap knowledge as our driving example.
            
         </p>
         <h3>Defining the Mini Article</h3>
         <p>
              The first thing PISF does to structure knowledge, is defining a short but strict template,
              called a Mini Article, that has seven things:
              
            <ul>
                   
               <li> A title </li>
                   
               <li> A written description of a problem </li>
                   
               <li> A picture explaining the problem </li>
                   
               <li> A caption to that picture </li>
                   
               <li> A written description of a solution to the problem </li>
                   
               <li> A picture describing the solution further </li>
                   
               <li> A caption to that picture</li>
                 
            </ul>
            
         </p>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/ma_template.png">
                   <img src="./bilder/ma_template_liten.png" alt="A short mini article">
                 </a>
              
            <figcaption>
                   A short but complete mini article.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              By reading a lot of RepRap blogs, I have observed that many of us perform small
              pieces of pretty well structured research. Often the aim of our little experiments
              is optimizing a small detail of our 3d printing setup. My thought was that the
              Mini Article template could serve a similar role as report templates does in the
              academical world.
            
         </p>
         <h3>Sorting Mini Articles</h3>
         <p>
              PISF stores these Mini Articles as seven nodes in a graph database. The layout
              looks like:
            
         </p>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/ma_flower.png">
                   <img src="./bilder/ma_flower.png" alt="A mini article in a graph database">
                 </a>
              
            <figcaption>
                   The layout of the Mini Article in the graph database.
                   The purple node carries the Mini Article itself,
                   the yellow nodes represent paragraphs and the blue ones represent pictures/figures.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              The paragraph nodes and the picture nodes may have relations that point into
              another set of nodes, called the "Category Bush". It looks like:
            
         </p>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/category_bush.png">
                   <img src="./bilder/category_bush_liten.png" alt="A category bush in a graph database">
                 </a>
              
            <figcaption>
                   The layout of the category bush, that works like a tag hierarchy. It's not
                   a tree because it may contain loops. The only thing not allowed is IS-relations
                   going both ways between two nodes.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <h3>Searching Mini Articles</h3>
         <p>
              Arriving on the <a href="http://tobbelobb.webfactional.com/print-issue-solution-filter">PISF homepage</a>,
              the user is presented with a set of checkboxes.
              The names of these are loaded directly out of the Category Bush by starting in the
              Reprap node (the green one in the figure above) and traversing one step outwards
              via IS-relations. When the user checks a box and presses <i>filter</i>,
              checkbox-structure is rebuilt, with the node corresponding to the checked boxes
              treated like the Reprap node was before, in its own hierarchy of sub-checkboxes.
              It looks like this:
            
         </p>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/checkbox_structure.png">
                   <img src="./bilder/checkbox_structure_liten.png" alt="Checkbox structure">
                 </a>
              
            <figcaption>
                   The hierarchical checkbox structure is drawn based on user input and
                   the category bush. This user is interested in Mini Articles about the model Huxley.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              Back in the graph database, PISF will find the paths of the following pattern:
            
         </p>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/hux_search.png">
                   <img src="./bilder/hux_search_liten.png" alt="Searching for Hux in PISF">
                 </a>
              
            <figcaption>
                   Any Mini articles with the following pattern of relations will be found
                   by PISF when searching for Model-related or Huxley-related articles. If the Huxley node had any
                   subcategory nodes, the Mini Articles with relations to them would also be counted
                   as relevant, so a Mini Article with relations more specific categories will
                   more often be found relevant by PISF.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              The user that just pressed <i>filter</i> will be presented with an updated list
              of Mini Articles. They are first sorted by relevance and then by number of votes. Relevance is found by
              counting the number of paths from the chosen categories to the respective Mini Article.
              That count is including the paths that go via sub-categories, but excluding the paths containing a
              loop in the category bush. It looks like this:
            
         </p>

              I just got my little web app, PISF, up and running on a server. Go check it out
              <a href="http://tobbelobb.webfactional.com/print-issue-solution-filter">here</a>!
              As you will see, it only has three articles as for now. Making it available
              to everyone was the last point on my prove-the-concept list. From here on I will
              seek input, inspiration, ideas from you guys. If people like it, maybe we can develop
              it further together.

              Web programming with common lisp has mostly been pure amusement. The few daunting moments
              I've had has mostly been caused by bugs in
              <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2531">Slimv</a>
              (once it actually refused to compile my code because of a parenthesis inside a comment!
              I feel like a bad person for not bug reporting that properly. Sorry), and other
              external programs.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              If you enjoy reading lisp source-code, here are a list of my favourite parts
              (see the <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/pisf">github repo</a> for the code):
              
            <ul>
                   
               <li>The macro <code>bind-cypher-returns-and-loop</code> found around line 50 in
                        <code>pisf-backend/pisf-backend.lisp</code>.
               </li>
                   
               <li>The package-wise logging system defined in the three <code>logging.lisp</code> files.
                        (Thanks to a git-repo I stumbled upon and stole this idea from. I honestly can't find it again.)
               </li>
                   
               <li>The macro <code>name-conventionize</code> found around line 30 in
                        <code>pisf-backend/pisf-backend.lisp</code></li>
                   
               <li>Discovering that a triangular pattern in a graph-database lets me
                        reuse nodes while avoiding confusion. Look at pictures in <code>pisf-backend/screenshots</code>
                        to see how the mini articles are laid out in the graph database.
                        The Cypher (database) queries needed to maintain this structure turned
                        out to be monsters, but that's another story.
               </li>
                   
               <li>Discovering that I did not have to worry about loops in the tag/category
                        hierarchy, because Neo4j will stop matching if it finds the same relationship twice
                        in a single path during a single search.
               </li>
                   
               <li>Discovering that I could sort based on relevance and based on votes, just by
                        adding <code>ORDER BY relevance DESC, votes DESC</code> in line 187 in
                        <code>pisf.lisp</code>.
               </li>
                   
               <li>Discovering that I could build a Cypher query in a loop quite easily.
                        This is used around line 510 in <code>pisf.lisp</code>, merely as a way of getting
                        around having to pass node-id's from one page to another, but amusing nonetheless.
               </li>
                   
               <li>A lot of <a href="http://weitz.de">Edi Weitz</a>' work, that I've taken huge advantage of,
                        is beautiful. <code>cl-ppcre:do-matches</code> made the job of writing
                        <code>escape-except-links</code> (line 370 in <code>pisf.lisp</code>) so easy,
                        I felt like I was cheating.
               </li>
                 
            </ul>
              Obviously there are plenty of flaws in the code too, but I don't want to start
              listing those in this blog post. Those are the worries of tomorrow.

              Getting Hunchentoot to actually serve outside my local network was a lot more
              tedious than I'd expected. In the end, I found a wonderful
              <a href="https://thephoeron.wordpress.com/2012/11/22/tutorial-running-hunchentoot-on-webfaction/">tutorial</a>
              that led me to <a href="https://www.webfaction.com/">webfaction</a>'s hosting service.
              My experience with them so far has been as awesome as they promise in their ads.
              Through ssh'ing my hired server, I've been able to
              
            <ul>
                   
               <li>Compile Clisp from source with already installed <code>make</code></li>
                   
               <li>Compile SBCL from source with newly compiled Clisp</li>
                   
               <li>Download and install Quicklisp</li>
                   
               <li>Download Oracle JDK 8 and Neo4j and run them</li>
                 
            </ul>
              In addition, opening a port for Hunchentoot to serve through was a breeze using
              the webfaction web interface, after a quick look at the documentation.

              I recently had the choice between doing a kamikaze soldering or buying another new
              Melzi board, after one of the small people in the family happened to rip the
              USB connector loose. Of course I chose the kamikaze soldering. I thought it
              should be possible because the data transferring connectors had all broke in the
              soldered points, so only solder was left on the PCB and all the data transferring
              legs were intact. I only had to apply heat and pressure. The preparation was
              in three steps:
            
         </p>
         <ul>
              
            <li>Make the soldering irons tip completely flat with a file</li>
              
            <li>Look really closely at the points to be soldered</li>
              
            <li>Do it several times with a cold soldering iron to rehearse</li>
            
         </ul>
         <p>
              I heated all the connectors simultaneously with the flat tip, for maybe one half
              second, and it was done. Three of the four non-transferring legs (the corners)
              had taken all the
              solder with them when they broke, so I used two component epoxy glue to attach
              them firmly to the PCB. The result looked like this

              When building this same Mendel this summer, I had an even worse soldering problem.
              Merlin mystically reported the z-home switch to always be open.
              Investigations with a multimeter and with the help of the
              <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Melzi">datasheet</a>
              showed that the problem was a bad solder on
              one of the processors legs! Luckily, this was one of the corner legs, so it
              was one of the most accessible ones. My friend <a href="http://www.dm9.se/">sluggo</a>
              taught me to file the soldering iron to a sharp point, like this

         <p>
              To avoid having to bend the processor leg, I wetted the tip with a minimal amount
              of solder that I scraped onto the processor leg, not waiting for the solder
              on the PCB to actually melt. This was the result

              It worked perfectly ever after. In general my open hardware stuff
              break more often than my other electronic hardware, but when it does it's more
              often possible to repair because datasheets, code, explanations etcetera are
              available. Occasionally I even learn something, and that has value too =)

         <div class="date">20-3-2014</div>
         <p>
              My girlfriend and I are getting married this summer, and we thought it would be
              nice to have the ring custom made, so I made a little sketch of our idea in OpenSCAD.
              The sea is important to us, so we wanted to
              symbolize that with a rope that runs in a track in the middle of an otherwise
              plain wedding ring.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              The plain ring with the track was really easy to get into OpenSCAD, because
              of the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/2D_to_3D_Extrusion#Rotate_Extrude"><code>rotate_extrude</code></a> function.
            
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                   The 2d outline of the plain ring with a track, that got rotated
                   into a ring by <code>rotate_extrude</code>. Thanks to jokern for suggestions
                   on how to model this.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              Cadding the rope was a bit trickier, because <code>rotate_extrude</code>
              doesn't take any twist-parameter or anything like that. This turned out to be
              a frustrating limitation, so I decided to try out
              <a href="http://openjscad.org/">OpenJSCAD</a> instead. To my delight, I found
              that it had a method called <code>solidFromSlices</code> that seemed to
              suit my needs.
            
         </p>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/openjscad.PNG">

            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              Unfortunately, <code>solidFromSlices</code> doesn't automatically detect that
              it has created a loop (OpenJSCAD maybe has other functions for that, I didn't
              get the complete overview), so the generated stl gets its "start-wall"
              (start of the rotation) and "end wall" intersecting inside.
            
         </p>

         <p>
              These self-intersecting surfaces made OpenSCAD refuse to <code>import</code>
              the rope-ring from OpenJSCAD. Oh no! :-O Fortunately, the intersecting
              surfaces had one special attribute that made them easily removable: They
              were all lying flat in the xy-plane. I made an ASCII-version of the stl,
              opened it with Gvim, and found several surfaces with normals exactly along
              the z-axis
            
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                   Looking inside the stl of the rope ring, I found several
                   facets with normal along the z-axis. Some of them had a
                   <code>facet normal 0 0 1</code> and some of them deviated from that with
                   a number of order -16. The last line in the picture shows how to search for
                   these facets with Gvim.

         <p>
              With all the intersecting facets removed, importing worked like a charm again.

         <div class="date">14-3-2014</div>
         <p>
              I recently tried out a trick I learned from
              <a href="http://numbersixreprap.blogspot.se/2012/07/pva-coated-print-bed-experiment.html">NumberSix's 3D printing blog</a>
              and <a href="http://richrap.blogspot.se/2012/06/more-scrap-art-gearboxes-and-panelmax.html">Richrap's blog</a>
              about applying a layer of diluted PVA a based glue to the kapton tape heat bed, to make PLA stick
              better. One part glue and nine parts water was the first I tried, and it did the
              trick perfectly for me. After having had problems with getting my glossy orange PLA to stick
              at all, big prints like this is now reliable like a walk in the forest

                   Big first layer of PLA on an PVA-prepped heat bed. Notice how
                   the kapton tape is slightly matte/white because of the thin glue layer. The
                   underside of the print gets a similar matte surface.

              As well as keeping large prints from not warping, it lets even the tiniest
              dots in a first layer stay in place. I tried two different glues that both worked fine.
              Here is one of them:

              This method may make your prints stick too hard to
              your printbed. Start with small amounts. Also,  first layer adhesion
              depends on a lot of things, and is being eagerly discussed on the
              <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?1,146446,146868">reprap forums</a>, so
              not everything will work for everyone, but this is my go to solution for now =)

              This is for you who somehow have gotten you a ready-to-use RepRap, but don't
              have any previous experience with either RepRap, 3d-printing or CAD software.
              We're going to print a calibration cube, and I'm just going to assume that
              everything goes smooth. Billions of things that can go wrong, but I will avoid
              mentioning too much about them.
              The programs chosen are just the ones I use. They're not good, nor bad. They

              compile and render it. The "Compile and Render" is done either by pressing F6,
              or by finding <em>Design &gt; Compile and Render (CGAL)</em> in the menus.

         <p>
              Slic3r is a program with many options. We're just going to look at ca five of them.
              First, we want to assure that the cube is printed as a solid cube. Click
              the tab called <em>Print Settings</em> and in the menu on the left click
              <em>Infill</em>. We want to set the <em>Fill density</em> to 1:
            
         </p>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/slic3r3.png">
                   <img src="./bilder/slic3r3_liten.png" alt="Slic3r infill options">
                 </a>
              
            <figcaption>
                   The first option we want to change in Slic3r is the fill density.
                   To prepare printing a solid figure, set it to 1.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              Click "Save" (the little blue icon) and note the name of your Printer Settings config
              (To the left of the blue icon). The next
              option we're going to change is in the <em>Filament Settings</em> tab.
              The default value for <em>Diameter</em> is 3. Measure the diameter of your
              filament with a caliper, and put the measured value into the <em>Diameter</em> field.
            
         </p>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/slic3r4.png">
                   <img src="./bilder/slic3r4_liten.png" alt="Slic3r filament">

            <figcaption>
                   Telling Slic3r that the filament I'm going to print with has a 1.75 mm diameter.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              Again, click "Save" and note the name of your Filament Settings config. Note that
              the default extruder temperature of 200 degrees Celsius works well if your
              filament is made out of PLA. If you're not sure what kind of filament you have,
              check it up first.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Also, if you don't have a heatbed, put
              the bed temperature of 0 degrees Celsius, like shown in the figure. If you have
              a heatbed, and will be printing with PLA, anywhere between 40 and 60 degrees Celsius
              is a good starting point for experimentation.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Next, we're going to look at <em>Printer Settings</em>. Measure the bed size of
              your printer. Feed the measured values it into the <em>Bed Size</em> fields,
              and put the values divided by 2 into the <em>Print Center</em> fields.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              The last value to check/update is in <em>Printer Settings, Extruder 1, Nozzle Diameter</em>.
              If you don't know your nozzle diameter, check it up and feed in the correct value.
            
         </p>
         <figure>
              <a href="./bilder/slic3r5.png">

            <figcaption>
                   Telling Slic3r that my RepRap's nozzle has a 0.5 mm diameter.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              Save your printer settings and return to the <em>Plater</em> tab.
              Assure that the names of the
              Print Settings config, Filament config and Printer Config
              are the same ones as the ones you saved to earlier.
              Next, press the <strong>Export G-code...</strong> button and save the .gcode file
              somewhere you will find it later on. You have now created the actual data that
              will be sent to your RepRap! The next step is learning how to send it.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Download and install <a href="https://github.com/kliment/Printrun">Printrun/Pronterface</a>.

              can be of help.
              When installed and executed, it should present to you a window similar to this:

         <p>
              Click the <strong>connect</strong> button. Hopefully the printer will respond
              with "Printer is now online." or something similar. On Windows machines, it will
              probably not. At least on W7 and older, you will need to install drivers
              to communicate with the printer.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              When the printer is connected, we want to load our gcode. Press
              <strong>Load file</strong> and select your file. Pronterface should now look
              something like this:

         <p>
              If you've come all the way here, you're now ready to press <strong>print</strong>.
              Your printer should respond by starting to heat up its hot end and start to
              print the first layer within a few minutes. The print will probably have an awful
              lot of problems, depending on how "ready-to-use" your printer really was.

              I would estimate a less than 1 % chance that the info in this post makes a total
              newbie able to print him/her-self a cube. You will probably need some more
              specialized info to get all the details right, but I hope this post has enabled you to ask the right
              questions and/or trump your way through some of the loops without noticing
              the potential pitfalls.

         <div class="date">28-2-2014</div>
         <p>
              I read Peter Blacker's excellent
              <a href="http://www.reprappro.com/creating-lithophanes-guest-blog/">blog post</a>
              about making lithophanes with RepRap recently,
              and was inspired to print a couple for my parents.
              I first found a nice picture of my Mom, and scaled it down to 300x200 pixels
              to make it easier to handle. I then used <a href="http://processing.org/">processing</a>,
              the
              <a href="http://workshop.evolutionzone.com/2011/04/06/code-modelbuilder-library-public-release/">Model builder library</a>
              created by Marius Watz and a
              <a href="https://github.com/amandaghassaei/Lithograph3DPrint">sketch</a> created
              by Amanda Ghassaei. Her <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Photograph/">instructable</a>
              contains details about installing the library and using the script.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              I put the file <code>Mom.JPG</code> in the same folder as the sketch and opened the sketch in
              Processing. I followed Peter Blacker's advice and set <code>zDim</code> to 2, so I got
              20 steps from white to black when printing at 0.1 mm layer height.
            
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                   The settings I fiddled with in Amanda Ghassaei's sketch. widthDim is
                   interpreted as millimeters by Slic3r (he stl format don't carry information about units).
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              I also gave the tip about cropping pictures and putting <code>thickness</code> to 0
              a go. The result was, as expected a very slim background, showing up as
              "snow" in Meshlab, like on an old TV without a signal

            <figcaption>
                   Two pink litophanes of my parents. If you click it and look closely
                   you see that dad's shirt was so light it resulted in a hole near his tie.
                   The "noise" around Mum on the left picture is supposed to depict real snow.
                 
            </figcaption>
            
         </figure>
         <p>
              Notice that the left litophane looks slightly more detailed than the right one?
              The right one was actually made with more pixels per mm (500 pixels wide), and
              had the same number of layers from white to black (20 x 0.1 mm).
              I think the reason for the difference in detail if that when I sliced
              the right one I was using "wipe on retraction", whereas when slicing the
              left one, I did not. Z-lift was used on both.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              Before slicing litophanes of pictures with some more important parts (like human faces),
              it can increase slicing speed to use the
              <a href="#reduce_faces_tip">reduce faces tip</a> on the unimportant parts.
              Mark the unimportant vertices before making the reduction.

              Too bad that this process was so technically demanding. It would like to teach
              my parents how to do it on their Reprap. Anyone has ideas about making it more
              seamlessly? Installing Processing and having to install libraries
              is a bit over their heads I think, but getting out too complicated stls causing
              Slic3r to hang is probably what will make them give up.

              My brother and his indie game company recently released the awesomely awesome
              game <a href="http://teslagrad.com/">Teslagrad</a>. To celebrate,
              I wanted to print him a monster from the game. An artist at the company,
              Aslak, sent me this impressive monster, called a Grue, in a CAD model:

              Even though I had a pretty snappy computer to work with, and the latest (1.0.0RC2)
              version of Slic3r, slicing
              hung time and time again. To make the slice possible at all, I did four things:
            
         </p>
         <ul>
              
            <li>Reduced the number of faces</li>
              
            <li>Used the resolution option</li>
              
            <li>Set "number of threads" to 1</li>
              
            <li>Set support material pattern to "rectilinear grid" instead of default "honeycomb"</li>
            
         </ul>
         <p id="reduce_faces_tip">
              Thanks to <a href="http://slic3r.org/blog">the Slic3r blog</a> for the first three these tips!
              Reducing the number of faces was mainly a matter of finding the option
              <em>Filters &gt; Remeshing, simplification and construction &gt; Quadratic Edge Collapse Detection</em>
              in Meshlab. More details about this is available
              <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/tutorials/polygon_reduction_with_meshlab">here</a>,
              but I found the number of faces to be the only important option.
              I simplified down to 300k faces without any noticeable artifacts, except when
              zooming in really close:

              To clean it up, I ran it through a Netfabb repair (locally of course, don't want
              to give away Aslak's work to the cloud service).
              The resolution option was set to the length travelled my one microstep on
              my x- and y-motors on my printer, and number of threads was set to 1, as mentioned
              earlier. The figure still wasn't sliceable on my machine though.

         <p>
              The big
              breakthrough, and also the big mistake I did then was to change the
              support material pattern. Slicing went smooth as a baby's bottom, and I started
              to print, but I had forgot to change the pattern spacing! It was left at the
              default 2.5 mm spacing, which is ok for a honeycomb pattern, but far too little for
              a rectilinear grid. The result was a nearly impermeable clump of
              PLA. After about three hours of fighting away support material, this is was what came
              out:

              The RepRap community definitely needs a more effective way to troubleshoot,
              than asking random strangers on forums. There should exist a quick troubleshooting

              After a short discussion with sluggo, we agreed that web apps that
              apply filtering of a database, with live updating, is a very effective
              user interface. In particular, we love the interface of shopping sites

              documentation to search for inspiration, and they had prepared

                   needed to be changed, no wires needed to be disconnected. Using only two

              To actually make the finishing touch to make the Mendel operative was much
              more difficult than expected. Troubles with electronics took most of the extra

              I had found cheap on ebay had the wrong sort of connectors
              (not screw connectors), and an Atmega 644p instead of an Atmega 1284p.
              The standard Melzi stepper drivers, A4988, also requires active cooling for currents

              For reasons I still don't understand, we could only control
              the motors to turn if we
              sat velocities really low. Maybe Marlin and Pronterface disagreed on whether to
              use absolute or relative coordinates, causing the movements sent from pronterface
              to be interpreted as impossibly fast (due to voltage rise times etc) by Marlin?
              In the end, one of the A4988's and the heat bed transistor burned because of
              too high motor current a frayed untinned HB connection respectively).
              I decided to buy a completely new
              Melzi from a new source (reprap.me), to tin all connectors and to only use motor
              currents less than 1 A.

            <li>Extruder motor just stuttered</li>
            
         </ul>

              The z-homing problem looked like
              <a href="http://youtu.be/eveQZXUCM1Q">this</a> (youtube video).
              Issuing M119 (Get Endstop Status) showed that Marlin thought the z-switch was
              always open. It was solved with a kamikaze soldering directly on the Atmega's one
              leg. It is described in an

              These troubles ceirtanly slowed the project down, and only one day was left
              of my summer holydays to teach my parents how to use the machine. The first
              print was a handle to a dipstick. It printed
              nicely like <a href="http://youtu.be/y6LerqXlAQg">this</a> (youtube video). And
              we soon went on to print a Julia vase (desperate attempt to convince Mum this

              At this point, my summer job in Oslo had started, so I could only work
              during weekends. Pace naturally slowed down. This gave the postal service time
              to catch up. I received endstop switches, glass bed, 623-bearings, hot-end,
              XLR-plug, stepper motors, the Melzi board and filament. Unfortunately, the filament I received had the wrong
              diameter, so the order must be placed again... Ordering is hard and depends on
              a lot of unknown factors.

         <div class="date">1-2-2014</div>
         <p>
              I've started working on a, as far as I know, new type of firmware.
              The main idea behind it is to minimize the need of processing power on
                the actual printer by reducing it to a slave that only relays low-level commands from the computer.
              Of course it will have to take care of some timing and buffering but that's about it.
              Since this type of protocol is not compatible with the current G-Code
                based one I'm also working on a driver that will emulate some generic G-Code receiving printer to make it work as a drop-in
            replacement.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              The upsides I see with the master-slave vs client-printer model are many,
              first of all unless you plan on equipping you printer with a &gt;100$
                cpu your computer will always be better at doing pretty much all the calculations needed for a print -
                thats why we do the slicing on it!
              Another key reason why I found the idea worth exploring is the much improved debugging capabilities,
                many G-Codes instructs the printer to perform several actions (e.g. G28 - home all)
                if any of these fail no further information than that the complete instruction failed is given.
              Now, using a printer that exports information about what pins it has
                and what they do and then simply receives ctrl-msgs pertaining those pins,
                i.e. a semi-transparent hardware abstraction protocol (kinda directly controlling the pins on the board using ctrl-msgs)
            or StAHP,
                each action can be performed with minute control giving the user the ability to pinpoint exactly when and where the printer
            fails.
              Having this type of control over the printer also means pausing,
                aborting, adding or subtracting parts (to/from) a running print-job will be much easier.
            
         </p>
         <p>
              A basic printer-computer handshake would look something like this (M - master/computer, S - slave/printer)
            <pre>format: seqno, sender: &lt;msg&gt;
00, S: &lt;init printer&gt;				// handshake init
00, M: &lt;printer confirm&gt;
01, S: &lt;printer id&gt;
01, M: &lt;printer id confirm&gt;
// M checks if it has Ss ctrls cached, if not:
02, S: &lt;N controls installed&gt;			// # controls on printer (N)
02, M: &lt;ctrls confirmed&gt;
03, S: &lt;ctrl 1: type&gt;				// type of ctrl 1 (stepper motor, fan ctrl, etc)
03, M: &lt;ctrl 1 type confirm&gt;
04, S: &lt;ctrl 1: func&gt;				// function of ctrl 1 (e.g. type = motor, func could be x/y/z-axis)
04, M: &lt;ctrl 1 func confirm&gt;
// further info about func exchanged
05, S: &lt;ctrl 1: M pins&gt;				// # pins for ctrl 1 (M)
05, M: &lt;ctrl 1 pins confirm&gt;
06, S: &lt;ctrl 1, pin 0: func&gt;			// function of pin 0 on ctrl 1
06, M: &lt;ctrl 1, pin 0, func confirm&gt;
07, S: &lt;ctrl 1, pin 0: min&gt;			// min value of pin 0
07, M: &lt;ctrl 1, pin 0 min confirm&gt;
08, S: &lt;ctrl 1, pin 0: max&gt;			// max value0
08, M: &lt;ctrl 1, pin 0, max confirm&gt;
... // this continues for all pins on all ctrls
R0, S: &lt;ctrl N, pin K-1: max&gt;			// where K is the number of pins on ctrl N
R0, M: &lt;ctrl N, pin K-1, max confirm&gt;
R1, S: &lt;max bufsz: L&gt;				// # ctrl-msgs that fit in the printers buffer
R1, M: &lt;bufsz confirm&gt;
R2, S: &lt;awaiting action&gt;
R2, M: &lt;awaiting action confirm&gt;
... // M can now start controlling the printer</pre>
              As seen the handshake time can be reduced quite much if the master has a cache of the printers ctrls.
              As such a cache (config) file could be easily produced when writing/porting the firmware
                to different boards hopefully the start-up time of printers using this type of firmware
                can be reduced to almost zero.

              This project is still in its infancy and the driver will probably not be ported to windows until the first stable version.

              I recently printed some twisted vases.
              They were drawn by using an
              <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Five_petal_flower_icon.svg" class="link">svg flower icon</a>,
              LibreCAD, Inkscape (with polymaker's

         </p>
         <p>
              I first opened the svg in Inkscape and saved it as "OpenSCAD DXF Output" (thanks to the plugin).
              I then removed unwanted edges, scaled it and centered it in LibreCAD.

              In OpenSCAD, the line of code to extrude the vase was

          convexity = 6,
          twist=130,

              I then exported as stl and imported it into Slic3r. To slice it a spiral vase, you need to tick a box
              and choose number of bottom layers. The only other relevant setting is extrusion width.

              I used an extrusion width of 0.83 mm for this large vase, to make it sturdy. Use lots of plastic
              (a fairly large extrusion multiplier or a similar setting) if you want the bottom to be water tight.

              I also experimented with rendering and slicing it on my 7 year old laptop.
              To make the laptop handle it, I had to remove 75 % of the line segments in the dxf. I did this by opening
              it in Gvim, and removing every second coordinate-pair with a little macro, twice.
              The coordinates are preceded by a line saying <code>AcDbPolyline</code>. Every x-coordinate is preceded
              with a line saying <code>10</code>, and every y-coordinate is preceded by a line saying <code>20</code>.
              To be able to do the CGAL compile and render in OpenSCAD, I also reduced the number of linear-extrude-slices.
              I also found I had to use a SD-card directly in the Melzi to get fast enough
              data transmission of the gcode.
              The result is
              the leftmost and biggest (I also scaled it up a bit) vase on this picture

                   It has the advantage that one can drill out the desired diameter in either end, so threaded
                   z-rods thicker or thinner than the shaft can be used.

              It turned out that the friction between the tube and the motor shaft was too low.
              The fix was just to change the upper zip tie with a hose clamp.

              The leftmost vase on the picture above has a little excessive edge on the bottom.
              This is due to a failed attempt to make it water tight, by welding a new
              bottom layer to it. To make this weld successful, I think you need to press
              it against surface hotter than the one I used, for a very short time (~ 1 sec). Aluminum
              foil in a hot frying pan might do the trick, I will try that next time. Here's

              For the z-axis, I had chosen M6 instead of M5, because I had a pair of M6 lying
              around. Making them, and their nuts fit into the printed x-motor-bracket and
              x-idler-bracket was a PITA, involving lots of difficult sanding. Even getting
              the M3 nuts down into the nut traps was really difficult and time consuming
              because of the small holes and overall low quality of my printed parts.

              Finally, I got 623 bearings (1.7 NOK each!) from Ebay, and Igus clip bearings
              and a hobbed bolt for the Mini extruder from eMakershop. I'm quite surprised that
              Igus clip bearings are used. They are pretty hard to find, even on the internet,
              and they seem easy to replace with a home made alternative. I would definitely
              replace them with printed nylon bushings in my own design.

              Today was a better shopping day. A local hardware store cut me the smooth rods
              I needed for 25 NOK. "And that gives us huge margins", was the owners comment
              on the price, so I guess smooth rods are really cheap when you buy in large
              quantities. If I had a garage, I would try to do that.

                   because the reprap.org wiki recommended at least 40 Ncm holding torque.

         <div class="date">29-1-2014</div>
         <p>
              Bought a bunch of screws and searched the whole town for seven 623-bearings.
              I only found three of them, and they were excessively expensive (nearly 100 NOK each!).
              Screws of size M2.5 weren't available either.
              Nobody in the hardware and electronics shops knew what an XLR-socket was, so I
              ended up buying on of a wrong type. Linear bearings of the type LM8UU were also
              impossible to find. One shop could order really expensive ones if I gave them
              the exact measures, but I declined. Couldn't find smooth 8 mm rods either.
              Conclusion:
              The parts needed to build a Reprappro Mendel are not readily available nor
              cheap in the city of Larvik.

              Four of the printed parts split in half because of a weak layer
              (had some problems with the extruder when I was printing them).
              They were easily glued together with two-component epoxy though.
              Enough hardship for today.
              One thing actually went really well. I managed to involve Dad when mounting
              together the skeleton:

              I think involving him in the build greatly increases the chances of him wanting
              to test it when it's operational.

              I also had a failed attempt to buy a Prusa Nozzle, which I would really like
              to try out. They were sold out. It's nice to see business going well for
              Reprap open hardware producers. There's lots of interesting hot ends out there,
              but to save time and effort I decided to go for a standard Reprappro
              hot end kit from Emakershop this time.

              Last summer holidays, I decided I wanted to build a Reprap to my parents to see how useful
              it could be to them as non-computer-wizards with little experience of the idea of
              3d-printing. To make it a little more interesting, I decided to use printed
              parts from my Printrbot+, <a href="http://vitana.se/opr3d/doku.php?id=skrivare:sigrid">sigrid</a>,
              and to buy the vitamins one at a time, preferably in Larvik.
              It would be a nice test of how available these Reprap parts really are (or of
              how good Larvik is as a hardware shopping city...).
              For BOM and all other information, I used
              the build-instructions from reprappro.com.
              I got to work immediately and ordered
              a heatbed:

              All the M8 threaded rods + nuts were bought in the local hardware store Biltema
              for 913 NOK. We could have saved 360 NOK by choosing galvanized steel instead
              of stainless, but dad thinks stainless looks better. Cutting the right lengths
              were done with dads grinder.

              Welcome, RepRappers!
              I've spent a lot of time RepRapping over the past year, so I thought it was time
              to make a blog about it. I'm planning to post at least once a week for at
              least 10 weeks forward. The posts will mostly be condensed everyday tinkering,
              but I have a hope that over time, I can use my knowledge from engineering physics studies
              to make some actually useful contributions to the RepRap community.
