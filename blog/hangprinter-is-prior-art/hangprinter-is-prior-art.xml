  <post id="prior_art_1" heading="Prior Art Relevant to Patent US 11230032" date="2-2-2022">
    <p>
        The <a href="https://wayfinder.digital/fedinvent/patents-2022/details-patents-20220125.html#11230032_DOE">patent in question</a> was filed on Apr 13, 2018.
        We will refer to the patented contraption as SkyBAAM, or "the patented contraption", for short.
        We will present prior art relevant to SkyBAAM, all of which was unmentioned and unreferenced in the patent.
        The prior art we present will mostly have been published within context of the open source project called Hangprinter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patent made only two references to Hangprinter:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangprinter">The Wikipedia Article</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.3ders.org/articles/20170308-frameless-hangprinter-reprap-turns-an-entire-room-into-a-3d-printer.html">An out of date article from 3ders.org</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Those two sources alone do not cover enough details to reveal how deeply similar SkyBAAM is to the pre-existing Hangprinter.
    </p>
    <h2>First Of All</h2>
    <p>
      The patent contains many ideas that have been explored, published, and then discontinued within the Hangprinter community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hangprinter prototype that was most visually similar to Fig 4 in the patent might be this
      early version 3 prototype, that was <a href="http://vitana.se/opr3d/tbear/2017#hangprinter_project_42">published and described in detail on April 4, 2017</a>.

      It's not only technical objects in the patent that bear similarities with prior Hangprinter publications.
      Their artistic expression is also strikingly similar.

        <a href="https://twitter.com/tobbelobb/status/849040245593165824">hangprinter.org was launched on Apr 4, 2017</a>,
          and the animation was there until it was <a href="https://twitter.com/tobbelobb/status/1308064219355648002">replaced on 21 Sep, 2020</a>.

      The artistic expression (as well as the physical implementation),
      of an unfinished circular tower with tall arched windows,
      and a thick helical structure along the outer wall,
      being 3d printed by a cable driven parallel robot with four cable-directions,
      one of which is near vertical,
      driving an effector with rotational degrees of freedom being constrained by pairs of generally parallel cables,
      of which anchors (called base stations in the patent) are potentially lifted above ground level with thin tall structures,
      was published widely on all 3d printing news sites in Feb/March 2017, a year before the patent was filed.
      Examples of such news articles include, but are not limited to:

    <p>
      However, the similarities between the patented contraption and Hangprinter are not merely superficial.
      This text will show similarities on the conceptual level in the form of ideas that were formulated, and sometimes also implemented within the Hangprinter Project,
      before they were reiterated in the patent.

    <h2>Prior Art Published in the Repo</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter">The main Hangprinter repo</a> is the heart of the Hangprinter project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hangprinter is developed following open source methodology.
      This means that all source files are published to the repo,
      freely for anyone to use,
      for any purpose, soon after they are created.
      They are also re-uploaded soon after any modification is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The re-uploads do not overwrite old work.
      Instead, each change is registered in an elaborate version control system (git/Github),
      that presents the newest version to the user, as well as saving and catalouging every previous version in chronological order.
      Catalouged versions are available through git and the Github web interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "source files" include, but are not limited to
      <ul>
        <li>CAD drawings</li>
        <li>Source code for programming the firmware of any microcontrollers involved</li>
        <li>Assembly and usage instructions</li>
        <li>A copyright license</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The version controlled, and publicly available directory that serves
      the source files to the general public is called "the repo".
      It can be found <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Was The Repo Publicly Available?</h3>
    <p>
      The general public had access and usage rights to the repo continously at all times since Dec 15, 2014, including on Apr 13, 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information about how popular and well known the repo was on Apr 13, 2018 can be found by using <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a>, also known as Wayback Machine.
      It is a service that stores and archives old web pages, so we can visit them again, and see exactly how they looked on given dates,
      superficially similar to how the git/Github saving and catalouging works.
      However, it does not save every web page every day, so the investigated dates will precede Apr 13, 2018 by weeks or months.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter looked on Jun 26, 2017:

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In the image we can see that the repo had 77 watchers, 248 stars, and 49 forks.
      This means that this was a popular repo at the time.
      The 49 forks means that at least 49 people have copied Hangprinter's source files
      to use as the basis for their own cable driven robot build.
    </p>
    <p>
      The license in the repo allows and encourages such copying.
      Hangprinter was the most popular and widely known basis for cable driven robot development in 2017 and 2018.
    </p>
    <h3>What Was In the Repo?</h3>
    <p>
      On Apr 13, 2018 the Hangprinter version 2 development had just been concluded (this happened on Feb 12, 2018).
      Work on Hangprinter version 3 had been going on since April 2017.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of the art of version 2 in the repo on Apr 13, 2018 can be found in the Github catalouge, <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/tree/c9295eceff474d44da9f7ad971b1a9f0303fea45">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of the art of version 3 in the repo on Apr 13, 2018 can be found in the Github catalouge, <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/tree/3fa54dbe37858ce02146a2d9f31bb17343fdf504">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how a state-of-the art Hangprinter version 3 looked like in CAD on Apr 10, 2018, according to the repo:
    </p>

        All individual parts were finished, but the file that renders their assembly was not finished.
        Still, we can clearly see the intent of having motors offloaded from the effector.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This is how a state-of-the art Hangprinter version 2 looked like in CAD on Apr 10, 2018, according to the repo:

        This is largely similar to the machine we saw in the 2017 news articles linked above.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h4>The Firmware</h4>
    <p>
      The firmware was also published in the same repo along with instructions of how to use them:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="./media/firmware_readme_v3.png">
        <img src="./media/firmware_readme_v3_small.png" alt="" width="500" height="293"/>
      </a>
      <figcaption>
        Click the image for a larger version.
        This is the README file from the firmware directory of the repo.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      A README file is common to include in any open source public repo, to help users understand how the source files are meant to be used.
      The firmwares of Hangprinter version 2 and Hangprinter version 3 were identical and interchangeable apart from default configuration values.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above README file told users of Hangprinter version 3, visiting on Apr 10, 2018, what they needed to know in order to use the firmware.
      Since the text in the image is very small, I will quote some important parts to highlight them.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Both Hangprinter v2 (master branch) and Hangprinter v3 (Gbg_version_3 branch) uses<br />
          - Arduino Mega + RAMPS running and old fork or Marlin, contained in this directory<br />
          - Three or four Mechaduino controlled steppers, running the firmware in the Mechaduino_subtree directory"
    </p>
    <p>
      The quote made clear that users had a choice to omit one of the four motors if they wanted to.
      This is because only 3 degrees of freedom are strictly needed to define a point in 3D space, as described in the patent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because cables can only pull, and not push the effector, at least one more force vector needs to work on the effector,
      in addition to those from the three lines themselves, in order to keep all lines tight.
      Some users preferred to use gravity, springs, and other tension controlling mechanisms, rather than buy a fourth motor and a fourth set of cables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second quote from the README describes a "tension controlling mechanism":
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mechaduinos are there to provide closed loop control (no skipped steps), torque mode, and for making automatic calibration (locating anchor points) possible.
      See <a href="https://vimeo.com/227893849">https://vimeo.com/227893849</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/227891846">https://vimeo.com/227891846</a> for demos of torque mode and autocal data collection."
    </p>
    <p>
      A Mechaduino is a type of circuit board that controls the movement of one motor, executing commands sent to it by the central controller, which is another circuit board.
      By sending a special command to the Hangprinter, the user could put any motor into "torque mode", and specify a requested constant torque.
      This would cause the motor to exert a constant torque on the cable rewinder, in the direction that winds cable inwards, creating a constant tension in the attached cable.
      Here's one of the linked videos that demonstrate it:

        Another video published on August 1, 2017, demonstrating how one can drag Hangprinter around by hand when in Torque mode (called tension control in the patent).
        In this case the tension control is used to help collect auto calibration data.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This is an example of a "tension control mechanism", frequently mentioned in the patent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the patent doesn't mention kinematics transforms in detail, I will mention Hangprinter's briefly here,
      to make the case that Hangprinter was capable of doing a superset of the effector movements that the authors envision in the patent.

        We see here that Hangprinter calculates its desired line lenghts by using Pythagoras' theorem on all its four cable directions.

    <p>
      The anchors can therefore be placed at arbitrary positions around the print volume, and the firmware will still work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The values of <code>anchor_A_z</code>, <code>anchor_B_z</code>, and <code>anchor_C_z</code> describe the z-positions of the three normally lower placed anchors.
      These three values, as well as all the other anchor position values, can be changed mid-print, as evindenced by the widely covered 2017 tall tower print.

    <p>
      All of these firmware features were <a href="https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/pull/9180#issuecomment-380536959">being merged into the world's most used firmware at the time</a>,
      called Marlin Firmware, in a public merge thread (similar to a forum thread) that was publicly available and open for anyone to read and participate in.
      This means Hangprinter and all its features were becoming an integrated and widely available type of 3d printer at the firmware level at the time before April 13, 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the merge thread, there were a mention of scaling Hangprinter up:
      <ul>
        <li>"I have seen videos on youtube , and the first thing I imagine , is the size limitless ......"</li>
      </ul>

      There's also an <a href="https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/9101">earlier merge thread</a> with important info.
      Comments made publicly on Jan 9, 2018 relate to the obvious idea of adding more motion axes (called "cable rewinders" in the patent) than four to Hangprinter.
      <ul>
        <li>"... It's would also give us trouble the day want to add a fifth motion axis, and a couple more extruders, which is not unlikely."</li>
        <li>"... This would allow fifth and sixth motion axes, along with additional extruders, to be easily added, but it would take some more work to implement."</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>The Second Thread</h3>
    <p>
      The second forum thread is 247 posts long, and 19 people took part in the open discussion.
      In it, I present and support the development of the Hangprinter version 2.
      You can find it <a href="https://reprap.org/forum/read.php?1,738858">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will re-post some relevant images and quotes here in chronological order.
      Not all quotes are mine, but all images are mine.
      All were posted between Jan 14, 2017 and Dec 16 2017.
      Further details are in the <a href="https://reprap.org/forum/read.php?1,738858">forum thread</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>"I think that this configuration lends itself very well to multimodal output drawing, laser CNC and 3d printing."</li>
      </ul>
      Then there's a discussion about where to place the motors (and therefore wire winches):
      <ul>
        <li><font color="blue">MechaBits</font>: "Was there a reason you never went with the motors on the walls?"</li>
        <li><font color="red">tobben</font>:     "Yup several reasons, of course. One of them is that I have to tidy up after me each time I've used the printer. <i> [part of quote left out for brevity] ...</i>"</li>
        <li><font color="blue">MechaBits</font>: "But surely you could also do that with motors on the walls."</li>
        <li><font color="red">tobben</font>:     "Quite possible, of course. I'd love to see such a solution."</li>
        <li><font color="blue">MechaBits</font>: "I would have thought you where in a better position to mentally picture what it would look like, due to your experience with this."</li>
        <li><font color="red">tobben</font>:     "Oh yes, you would have to choose between synchronizing steppers wirelessly, drive them from a stationary PCB or to find a smart way to wind stepper cables. <br /><br />

Last alternative first: You could carry the stepper drivers and the microcontroller on the moving part. Signal noise because of the stepper cable lengths would be no (or a very small) problem, but they will of course have weight. You could wind in the motors when not in use and park everything in the ceiling. Nice. <br /><br />

Wireless motor control is probably the best solution for very big high-performance machines. You must do more programming, need more PCBs and more power supplies. The PCBs could be placed almost anywhere and you don't need to hide a lot of ugly cables. Semi nice. <br /><br />

With one stationary PCB and long cables to stationary motors, it will be a lot of work to make it look tidy. You will have to transform your entire room into a RepRap frame. If quick and dirty solutions, like cables taped to the floor/ceiling, works for you, and if you never need your room for something else, then this solution gives you the most print performance for your time and your buck. Or at least, that's my guess."</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>"Have you thought about the use of a laser pointer or rangefinder aimed at the corner that would give a digital distance to the computer? More expense that way. I have seen IR sensors that can determine distance for about 20 dollars."</li>
        <li>"I've thought about multiple different distance measurement solutions. My pet idea right now is using draw-wire displacement sensors like this: <i>[omitted]</i> ... in combination with accelerometer/gyro like described here:  <i>[omitted]</i>"</li>
        <li>"Sensors that allow an automatic calibration and/or homing procedure. Many sensor setups could achieve this:<br />
            <ol type="1"><li> Metal tubes on each line that can close a circuit</li><li> Accelerometer+gyro (IMU) units</li><li> Sound sensing (maybe 1 mic + 5 speakers)</li><li> Draw-wire displacement sensors in each direction</li><li> Optical sensing from salvaged computer mice</li><li> Small touchpad area on the build plate. For example calibrating and homing with a tablet or smart phone below print head."</li></ol></li>
        <li>"Note that both the stl and the above image shows doubled lines along all axes (for mechanical advantage). <i>[part of quite ommitted ...]</i> If you want double mechanical advantage along A, B and C, you must specify that in Configuration.h"</li>
      </ul>
      We then discussed placement of anchors:
      <ul>
        <li><font color="blue">L0g4n</font>: " ... why not put the anchor points on the ceiling as well?"</li>
      </ul>
    <figure>
      <a href="./media/three_high_anchors.jpg">

    </figure>
      <ul>
        <li><font color="blue">L0g4n</font>: " ... why not put the anchor points on the ceiling as well?"</li>
        <li><font color="red">tobben</font>: "The setup to the right would work well, especially when lines are at a ca 45 degree angle. My main reasons for not choosing it for Hangprinter was<br />
          <ul>
            <li>Accelerations are limited by gravity. Maximum acceleration is equal to that of a pendulum.</li>
            <li>Slightly trickier to park in the ceiling when not in use."</li>
          </ul></li>
      </ul>
        Then a comment on placement of motors, and printing of houses with concrete again.
      <ul>
        <li>"If you placed he motors on the frame that would give you a lighter carriage with potentially faster kinematic speeds."</li>
        <li>"you can build complete houses with a big enough setup and a concrete dispenser as tool"</li>
      </ul>
        Next followed a question that touches upon some of the claims presented in the patent
      <ul>
        <li><font color="blue">L0g4n</font>: "did you consider using just a single vertical line and account for the sled tilt due to the tension in the side lines in the math?"</li>
        <li><font color="red">tobben</font>: "No, I never thought about this. Hangprinter currently doesn't measure tension. It measures nothing other than hot end temp. Looking forward to see a lot of sensor experimentation!"</li>
      </ul>
        Next we mentioned the constant force mode, later called torque mode:
      <ul>
        <li>"It's also possible to drive steppers in constant force mode =) See the Mechaduino Project and some ongoing discussion about that here: [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/hangprinter/permalink/185601638616670/">www.facebook.com</a>]"</li>

    <h2>Prior Art Published On in the Facebook Group</h2>
    <p>
      The idea of 3d printing houses with Hangprinter was frequently discussed in the Hangprinter Facebook group around 2017 and 2018.
      At least one of these conversations included some visuals.

        Screenshot from the facebook group called "Hangprinter - RepRap Project " on March 17, 2018.
        A person called Ed Aylward posted visuals, related to the common idea of scaling up Hangprinter for printing concrete buildings, in the facebook group, stating patent pending on the idea.
      </figcaption>

    <p>
      I will point out some important details in the image above.
      In the top right corner, we see the computer displayed the current date at the time: "Sat Mar 17 20:02".
      The year 2018 is confirmed in the bottom right, where it says: "Facebook © 2018"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the top left corner, it says "public group".
      The group had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/hangprinter/posts/194019467774887/">over 200 members and increasing, already a year earlier</a>.
      This was a big public group with very active discussion about Hangprinter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a part of the conversation in the screendump, suggesting a crane with wheels, as we saw in the SkyBAAM patent:
      <ul>
        <li><font color="blue">Jeff Smith</font>: "Crane looks a bit more permanent than the building... You know they make those with wheels right?"</li>
        <li><font color="green">Ed Aylward</font>: "yes of course"    </li>
        <!--li><font color="red">tobben</font>: "Mr Aylward has emailed me three times before, with talk of getting rich through a patent.<br /><br />
          You are welcome to get rich from using Hangprinter, Mr. Aylward. It is my honest opinion that you are wasting your time with this patent nonsense.<br /><br />
          I have no money, you if you plan to sue me there is nothing there for you to win. As indicated by the above conversation, you will spend your time fighting the Hangprinter Community, not with getting rich."</li-->
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the conversation, we see that Mr Aylward had posted two hours earlier:
      <li>A link to a web page</li>
      <li>An image</li>
      <li>A text: "3D CONCRETE BUILDING PRINTER. INVESTORS WANTED. Patents Pending, ©All rights reserved. (not to scale)"</li>
    </p>
    <p>
      The web page that Mr Aylward linked to in his post was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180228165805/https://p3d.in/O6NBW+welcome">saved by Wayback Machine on 28 Feb, 2018</a>,
        so he had clearly created it at least a few days before posting publicly.
      At the time of writing this, <a href="https://p3d.in/O6NBW">the web page is still up</a>.

      The linked web page, as well as the image posted in the public facebook group, showed a 3d model of Hangprinter version 1,
      that had been copied straight from the Hangprinter repo

        Click the image for a larger version.
        Aylward's web page displays 3d graphics, and lets us zoom in on the displayed object.
        We can see that this is Hangprinter version 1, and not version 2, because it does not yet use a worm gear for its D-axis (mostly vertical axis), like the Hangprinter version 2 did.
        If we search through Github's catalouge, we can probably pin down when it was downloaded because it includes a distinct bug:
        there are two motors with "B-gears", both driving the "B-lines" in the render.
        That bug would make the machine not work as intended in practice, and was probably removed soon after, in the real Hangprinter repo.
        The three low anchors are also identical to those published as Hangprinter version 1 anchors in the Hangprinter repo.

      Searching with Google Patents and <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/">PPUBS Patent Public Search</a> with our best efforts, shows no trace of Edward Aylward's patent claim.
      He could have been refused, or he might not have filed for a patent afterall.
      We will therefore consider Aylward's publication in the public Hangprinter group as prior art.
    </p>
    <!--p>
      The conversation received a lot of attention, and the conversation was deleted by a moderator later that day for reasons that are unknown to me.
      Aylward were also blocked from the public group the same day, also for reasons unknown to me.
      I was not the creator of, nor a moderator of, the public Hangprinter group on Facebook.
    </p-->

    <h2>What About the Guy Wires?</h2>
    <p>
      The patent in question describes guy wires going from the D-anchor (high-up) anchor down to the anchors (base stations) with tension in them to pull
      the D-anchor downwards and outwards, and hence stabilizing it.
      See for example lines 36 in Fig 4 from their patent, near the top of this web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have never used the term "guy-wire" much in the Hangprinter community.
      However, we've had lines going between the D-anchor and the lower anchors, just like guy wires would, since April 2017.
      See for example the video posted at the top of this article, or this image that was published on Dec 7, 2017:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="./media/people_want_to_reprap.JPG">

        Hangprinter version 3 being demonstrated on Maker Fair Rome in December 2017.
        Lines pulling the D-anchor down towards all three low anchors, with fixated start points and end points, are visible in the image
        against the white background.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Although Hangprinter's guy wires are rerouted to also serve as transmitting motion forces to the end effector,
      these lines double up to do the same guy-wire pulling as the static cables mentioned in the patent would do,
      as long as all the lines are always tight, which they always are since the machine would otherwise loose
      control over the effectors translational movement.
    </p>

    <h3>Non-Hangprinter Prior Art</h3>
    <p>
      It's worth looking at the SkyDelta, and note that it too has striking similarities to the patented contraption.
      I won't go into the details here, but in the detailed blog post from 2013 linked above, Brandon Heller includes a video that
      shows similarities from an overview perspective:
    </p>

        Like most cable driven translation robots, Hangprinter included,
        it uses pairs of cables that are "generally parallel to each other" as it's formulated in the patent.
