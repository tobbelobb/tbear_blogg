         <div class="date">9-2-2022</div>
         <p>
                The <a href="https://wayfinder.digital/fedinvent/patents-2022/details-patents-20220125.html#11230032_DOE">patent in question</a> was filed on April 13, 2018.
            We will refer to the patented contraption as SkyBAAM, or "the patented contraption".
            We will present prior art relevant to SkyBAAM, all of which were unmentioned and unreferenced in the patent.
            We find most of our prior art examples within the open source project called Hangprinter.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The patent contains many ideas that have been explored, published, and then discontinued within the Hangprinter community
                  before April 13, 2018.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  This writing will be long and detailed.
                  The corpus of relevant prior art published publicly before April 13, 2018, is vast
                  since the Hangprinter Project was already four years old at the time.
                  This prior art includes, but is not limited to:

         </p><br><h2>Hangprinter References In the Patent</h2>
         <p>
                  The patent made two references to Hangprinter:
                  
            <ul>
                       
               <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hangprinter&amp;oldid=831632485">The English Wikipedia article, which was mostly just a list of links at the time</a></li>
                       
               <li><a href="https://www.3ders.org/articles/20170308-frameless-hangprinter-reprap-turns-an-entire-room-into-a-3d-printer.html">An out of date article from 3ders.org</a></li>
                     
            </ul>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Those two sources alone do not cover enough details to reveal how deeply similar SkyBAAM is to the pre-existing Hangprinter.
                  I will therefore present a selection of prior art here, picked from the long list above.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I will comment on prior art covering the highest level, most general ideas presented in the patent first,
                  and slowly zoom in on technical details and implementation.
                  However, some similarities are visible at a distance, without further explanation.
                  I will cover those first.

                  The same prototype was also described in some detail
                  <a href="http://vitana.se/opr3d/tbear/2017#hangprinter_project_42">in a blog post on April 4, 2017</a>.

         <p>
                  The patent seems very broad.
                  I might have misunderstood it because it's hard to read.
                  Let's try to read it closely.
                
         </p>
         <h2>So What Does The Patent In Question Cover?</h2>
         <p>
                  I tried to understand the claims section of the patent.
                  As an engineer, I must say, the claims section reads like someone is preparing for a post-modernistic poetry slam competition.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  From reading only the claims, it sounds like the patent tries to cover
                  the field of translational parallel cable-driven robotics in its entirety,
                  or a very significant portion of it as if it didn't already exist.
                
         </p>
         <h2>Any Number Of Lines And Base Stations</h2>
         <p>
                  Formulations like these in the detailed description give a similar, overly general impression:
                  
            <ul>
                       
               <li>"[...] an outdoor work site. Smaller-scale and/or indoor implementation are also contemplated"</li>
                       
               <li>"one or more additional base stations"</li>
                       
               <li>"one or more additional adjustable cables may be associated with any of the base stations"</li>
                       
               <li>" the base stations 22A, 22B, 22C can include at least one pulley 42, multiple pulleys, or another suitable cable guide which
                  route the cables 28A, 28B, 28C to change the direction of the force applied by the cables"
               </li>
                     
            </ul>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Maybe the rest of us will have to continue our research on machines with three or fewer base stations, then?
                
         </p>
         <h3>Hangprinter's Number of Anchors</h3>
         <p>
                  As we will see later, in the firmware section, adding one anchor does not increase the computational complexity of the
            kinematics.
                  The option of adding more motors and anchors <a href="https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/9101#issuecomment-356319633">was being taken care of and discussed publicly before April 13, 2018</a>.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                    It was also widely understood in the Hangprinter community that we sooner or later would
                    want to <a href="https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/Hangprinter#Anchor_Module">add more anchors to Hangprinter</a>.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  That was easy to understand because many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HNAL8ZKdyM">translational parallel cable-driven robots</a> with similar goals as ours
                  already had more than four anchors
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCa8uDFzbsw">a long time before April 13, 2018</a>, thereby reaching larger volumes and better performance overall.

                         Notice that at the time, we mixed up the Z-axis and the D-axis, just like the authors of the patent.
                         It's a common mistake for beginners.

                  Its rotations around the z-axis were completely unconstrained, a property it could have in common with the contraption
            on Fig 2 in the patent if the two attachment points or the 28B are stacked vertically.
                  Therefore, these machines' end effectors oscillate like a <a href="https://youtu.be/GGO2I_sN8hI">torsion pendulum</a> (not prior art) during operation.

                  We even experimented with using suspended closed loop belts instead of cable winder spools
                  so that we could tie in any number of lines to the belt at any time, like this:

                         I published this image on my blog <a href="http://vitana.se/opr3d/tbear/2017#hangprinter_project_42">on April 4, 2017</a>.
                         It shows how we created a cable-driven axis by tying a line to a belt loop.
                         I described it as a concept of spanning up linear actuators between winch and ABC anchor points.
                         The caption from the post says: "The yellow loop runs around the motor shaft and an idler. The grey line is tied
               onto the yellow loop."

                  We kept the D-line a single one (or "doubled up" however you see it).
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  It turned out that if the D-line attachment point was singular, then the end effector needed three attachment points
            in all the ABC-directions
                  to constrain its rotations properly.

                  The number of anchors and lines in a parallel cable-driven robot is quite fluid and easily adjustable.
                  Specifying a set of fixed numbers or saying "one or more" does not constitute an invention in the field.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Anyways, let's see if something in this patent might still be valid.
                
         </p>
         <h2>Probably Mistaken Descriptions Of SkyBAAM's Motion System</h2>
         <p>
                  If we read the patent more closely,
                  it turns out that the patent's claim 1 and the detailed description
                  narrow the scope down considerably if taken literally.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  A stationary end effector is described in several places.
                  Maybe they are all mistakes.
                  I will explain.
                
         </p>

                  "FIG 4. [...] three adjustable suspension cables 30 run from the aerial hoist 18 to the end effector 20, and perform
            the z-axis motion"
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Since "the fixed platform 34" is stationary,
                  the formulation "z-axis motion" indicates that
                  the end effector 20 can only move along a straight vertical line.
                  Like this:

                       Hangprinter version 3, assembly file as it looked <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/tree/3fa54dbe37858ce02146a2d9f31bb17343fdf504">in the Hangprinter repo on April 10, 2018</a>.
                       We were unaware at the time that our machine, even in this stripped-down form, could deserve a patent.

         <p>
                  Movements "along the z-axis" and movements "towards the highest anchor" are generally not the same in a Hangprinter
            type of robot.
                  They are only the same if the end effector is situated directly below the highest anchor and moves in a straight line
            towards or away from the highest anchor
                  (given that the z-axis of the machine is vertical, which the patent text states clearly elsewhere).
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The statement that the hoist "controls linear translation along the z-axis" or is "at least a portion extending along
            the z-axis" is repeated eight times in the patent, including in claim 1.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  In a Hangprinter type of robot, all the cable-driven movement axes are involved in controlling any linear motion of
            the end effector.
                  If you want to move along a straight line, you must adjust the length of all the cables connected to the end effector.
                  No anchor, not even the highest one, has any particular relation to either of the x, y, or z-axes of the Cartesian coordinate
            system.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  That understanding makes the patent's description of the movement system sound very narrow, bordering on the unexpected.
                  Let's help the patent authors by assuming they made a mistake.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  After all, Fig 4 is only "another embodiment of a cable configuration for the cable-driven additive manufacturing system".
                  So let's look closer for details that differentiate it from Hangprinters and other embodiments.

         <h3>Descriptions of Angles and Constraints In The Patent Text Are Wrong</h3>
         <p>
                  "One difference is that three adjustable suspension cables 30 run from the aerial hoist 18 to the end effector 20 [...]
            all run off one cable winder 32 [...] so that their length is always identical."

                       Video published December 8, 2016, demonstrating a worm drive on the D-axis onboard cable rewinder.
                       We were unaware at the time that having three lines around a single spool could constitute an invention, so we didn't
               mention it, but it's visible.
                       The "cable rewinder" is onboard the end effector.
                       At the start of the video, the "aerial hoist" is shown in the form of free-hanging bearings.

                  "This keeps the end effector 20 from tilting, which freezes two rotational DOF of the end effector 20."
                
            <p>
                   
            </p>
                  I'm unsure what "freezing" means here since degrees of freedom are independent of degrees of temperature.
                  Ok, let's assume they made a mistake again.
                  They surely mean "constrains two rotational DOF", right?

         </figure>
         <p>
                  Even if they meant "constrained", they would still be in error.
                  Those rotational degrees of freedom are not constrained in either of their Figs 4 or 5.
                  That's because they specify that all cables, and hence anchors are in the x-y plane:
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  "... freezes all the rotational DOF [...].
                  First, by putting more cables in the x-y plane, the stiffness of the system 14 is increased in the x-y plane."
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  In claim 1 of the claims section, and ca ten other places in the patent text,
                  the patent authors insist on
                  base stations being the ones who control motions in the x-y plane specifically:
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  "motion-control base stations disposed below the aerial hoist and configured to control linear translation of the end
            effector in an x-y plane defined by the x-axis and the y-axis".
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  That is the same mistake as with the "z-axis" above.
                  In reality, all lines are extended or shortened during any linear movement, and base stations can not be constrained
            to only control motions in an x-y plane unless
                  all of the machine's moves are in that exact plane.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  One section of the detailed description in the patent tells us more about what the authors intended to describe.
                  They want to allow the lower cables to tilt up to 20 degrees (upwards?) during operation:
                  "... or alternatively up to 20 degrees from parallel to the x-y plane during operation."
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But that's probably not enough either.
                  In reality, these angles get steep quickly when the end effector moves close to an anchor (base station).
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  These angles will not be "substantially in the x-y plane" or any other fixed plane.
                
         </p>
         <h3>Last Geometry Nitpick, I Promise</h3>
         <p>
                  I'm trying to assume that they're honestly trying to describe regular translational 3d movements
                  as other translational cable-driven parallel robots do,
                  but the patent's authors don't make it easy for me:
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  "From the pulleys 42U, 42M, and 42L to the end effector, the cables 28U, 28L can run generally orthogonally to the support
            surface 60."
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The number 60 they're talking about is the front plate of this thing:

                  So, if the cables 28U and 28L are orthogonal to the front plate 60, the end effector can only move along a parallel
            line to plate 60's normal direction.
                  With three different normal directions, this again constrains the end effector to stay put at a single point in space
            (or probably at no point in space, if we're going full-on mathematical about it).
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  In reality, the lines 28U and 28L will not stay orthogonal to 60, not even close, not even "generally".
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Let's assume the patent's authors made another mistake.
                  We wouldn't want the patent authors to have patented this very general situation inadvertently:

         <h2>Telescoping Framework: For More Substantially Horizontal Lines</h2>
         <p>
                  The patent authors get back on track by specifying:
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  "In one embodiment, at least a portion of the base station 22 can telescope to raise the pulleys 42U, 42M, and 42L."
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  So we're back up to one embodiment of their patented contraption that can carry out linear vertical motions
                  by utilizing a total of at least seven motors.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The telescopes are supposed to act like linear vertical axes that can lift the pivot points of the lower lines.
                  We can see that in Fig 2, or look at earlier Hangprinter implementations of the same thing:

                       We see the lower lines lifted by black v-shaped bearings attached to yellow carriages that travel along linear rails.
                       Baez published this and several other similar but not identical Hangprinters in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/176856636157837/search/?q=baez">December 2017 and January 2018</a>.

                       It can "raise the pulleys 42U, 42M, and 42L",
                       "... to allow the end effector 20 to print taller structures without interfering with the cables".

         </figure>
         <p>
                  So the idea of lifting Hangprinters anchor points during a print was something we practiced before the patent's filing
            date.

                       In this video from April 15, 2017, it's clear that the ABC-lines are terminated at different z-heights during different
               parts of the print.
                       The D-anchor was likewise moved upwards mid-print.
                       They would otherwise have been too long and acted too much like springs during the lowest layers.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  Moving the anchor points' positions around required pausing and resuming the print in the video above.
                  Avoiding the pause/resume cycle by motorizing this linear movement and potentially making it continuous
                  should be considered an obvious idea for scaling up a Hangprinter.

                  We will get back to the firmware details later in this text.
                  Let's first look at how SkyBAAM planned to do it:

         </figure>
         <p>
                  I am a bit amused by the base station thing with wheels to the right in fig 3.
                  Have they invented a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_crane">mobile crane</a>, restricted it to purely vertical crane motion,
                  and removed all but one pair of wheels?
                  Also, instead of anchoring the guy wires to the ground,
                  they anchor the guy wires to the little truck.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Oh well. Just don't pull too hard in 28A, and wear a helmet, alright?
                  The weight of the sagging suspension wire 28A in itself could be enough to make base station 22A fall over on its side,
                  particularly on a windy day.
                  See Appendix for better ideas.

         <h2>But SkyBAAM Has An Aerial Hoist! Hangprinter Sources Never Mention Aerial Hoist!</h2>
         <p>
                  Yes, the patent authors have invented their own jargon to describe their cable-driven robot idea.
                  That's cute but also a bit confusing.
                  Let's look closer at the "aerial hoist".
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  "The base station 22 can optionally include a cable winder 50 for a suspension cable 30 used to adjust the position
            of an aerial hoist 18 (FIG. 8)."
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Let's look at Fig 8 and Fig 2.
                
         </p>

         </figure>
         <p>
                  After some deep reading of the patent, it turns out that the aerial hoist is a spring-connected pulley,
                  just like the ones used in common homework problems in introductory mechanics courses.

         </figure>
         <p>
                  The springs (nr 74 in Fig 8) have the same effect as flexibility in the suspension cable.
                  Since the UHMWPE lines of Hangprinter already provide more flex than we need, we've never attached explicit springs
            to our machines.
                  We'll come back to the explicit spring later in this text.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  So, the "aerial hoist" does the same job as the v-shaped bearings in this image (except Hangprinter avoids springs if
            it can):
                
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                       This image shows the "aerial hoist" of Hangprinter version 1.
                       The cable rewinder is part of the end effector itself.

         <p>
                  However, the "aerial hoist" in Fig 8 "in one embodiment" redirects the line towards an anchor ("base station"),
                  so that all motors can potentially be located at ground level.
                  Once again, we can look at Hangprinter prior art to explain what they mean.

         <p>
                  SkyBAAM's aerial hoist also redirects the cable, one could say.
                  But Common cable blocks redirect all cables of all cable-driven robots in practice.
                  Motor placement on a cable-driven robot is entirely arbitrary because cable redirection is cheap and straightforward.

                  If the "invention" of the patent in question is the concept of routing lines through elaborate cable guides,
                  fairleads, or blocks,
                  then let's consider these very early sketches as prior art:

                       All the blue and purple you see are bearings.
                       I'm not proud of this blurb, as it over-complicates the simple task of routing lines, much like the patent's Fig 8
               does.
                       Doing so is a common mistake for aspiring Hangprinter designers.

         </figure>
         <h2>But SkyBAAM Adds Springs! More Cleverer Than Hangprinter, No?</h2>
         <p>
                  It's true that Fig 8 includes explicit springs (74) between the top hook and the cables and that Hangprinters don't
            have this.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Introducing springs here and there to keep lines tight or avoid over-tightening is a common beginner's mistake when
            designing Hangprinters
                  because it reduces positional control, limits maximum speeds and accelerations, and introduces eigenfrequencies in the
            motion system.
                  Adding springs to Hangprinter
                  has <a href="https://reprap.org/forum/read.php?178,344022,345158#msg-345158">been discussed</a> many times.
                  We don't add springs because there is already more than enough flex in its UHMWPE lines.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  However, earlier open source translational cable-driven parallel robots did use explicit springs,
                  like for example, this one:

                       Brandon Heller's Youtube video from 2013 shows the SkyDelta that predates Hangprinter.
                       Like most cable-driven translation robots, Hangprinter included,
                       it uses pairs of cables that are "generally parallel to each other", as it's formulated in the patent.
                       It also uses rubber bands to pull upwards, much like the patented contraption uses its springs.

         </figure>
         <p>
                  The way forward for all Hangprinters, from Mini to SkyBAAM size, is to handle, and possibly plan for,
                  the flex and springiness in the lines (or in the actual springs, if you add them voluntarily as SkyBAAM does).

                  To be clear, the original Tower of Babel myth does not describe a 40x40x460 cm tower made of plastic.
                  The artistic idea was to make the audience imagine something huge, dwarfing the Colosseum.

                  Printing buildings with Hangprinter was on my mind before the Babel Print Project,
                  and I tried to make that evident by choosing the Tower of Babel as my motive.

                       Ed Aylward posted visuals related to the common idea of scaling up Hangprinter for printing concrete buildings in
               the Facebook group, stating patent pending and "all rights reserved".
                       The idea of a "crane with wheels" (mobile crane) is also discussed in the conversation.

                  It was a big and rapidly growing public group with active discussions about Hangprinter, open for anyone to see, including
            non-members.

                  Initially, however, it was unclear whether the "invention" in these visuals was to

                  Luckily, Aylward included an object of known size in his 3d visualization:

                       Aylward's web page displays 3d graphics and lets us zoom in on the displayed object.
                       We can see that this is Hangprinter version 1 and not version 2 because it does not yet use a worm gear for its D-axis
               (mostly vertical axis), like the Hangprinter version 2 did.
                       If we search through Github's version history, we can probably pin down when Aylward downloaded it because it includes
               a distinct bug:
                       two motors with "B-gears", both driving the "B-lines" in the render.
                       That bug would make the machine not work as intended in practice and was removed soon after in the actual Hangprinter
               repo.
                       The three low anchors are also identical to those published as Hangprinter version 1 anchors in the Hangprinter repo.

                  The image would imply that the "invention" was a combination of the two above.
                  A colossal toy mixer truck, pushing a cylinder down through a standard Hangprinter via a tiny crane.

                  Ok, I am just kidding.
                  The "print houses" idea is obvious, even in Aylward's posts.

         <h2>But The Super Smart Tension Control Described In the Patent, How About That?</h2>
         <p>
                  In the Hangprinter Community, we call it "torque mode".
                  All Hangprinter anchors have this tension control.

                       Video published August 1, 2017.
                       All four motors are in torque mode in the video.
                       Since torque mode (tension control) only controls the torque of the motors (and hence the tension of the cables),
                       the end effector will move if you push it around by hand.

         <p>
                  Torque mode has been a standard feature since 2017.
                  It's convenient and lets you start the printer up and move the end effector safely and rapidly without overthinking.
                  Usage during printing is possible but uncommon.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Torque mode is also used during auto-calibration (automatic anchor localization within the Cartesian coordinate system).
                  During auto-calibration, it's common for a Hangprinter to mix the normal "position mode" with torque mode,
                  frequently switching modes for individual motors.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  A non-linear minimization algorithm is applied to transform the set of collected quadruples of motor positions,
                  into four anchor locations.
                  The algorithm version available on April 13, 2018, can be found here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/tobben/auto-calibration-simulation-for-hangprinter/-/tree/a3e7878987f88ff29ca2785d49390a34414e9027">auto-calibration-simulation-for-hangprinter</a>.

                       Video published September 4, 2017.
                       It shows a Hangprinter version 3 moving automatically around in its build volume, alternating between
                       position mode and torque mode to figure out the correct Cartesian coordinates of its anchors.
                       In the video, the D-motor (the one pulling towards the highest anchor) is most often in position mode, while the A,
               B, and C motors
                       (the three pulling towards the lowest anchors) alternate between position mode and torque mode.
                       However, the Hangprinter can do of any combination of position and torque modes
                       and may switch between them on the users' command, during print, or whenever.

                  Fun fact: the precursor to Hangprinter's torque mode was called "button mode".

                  If the somewhat vague tension control concept in the patent involves measuring the tension along the line, that's ok.

                  cables. Semi nice. <br><br>
                  With one stationary PCB and long cables to stationary motors, it will be a lot of work to make it look tidy. You will have
                  to transform your entire room into a RepRap frame. If quick and dirty solutions, like cables taped to the floor/ceiling, works
                  for you, and if you never need your room for something else, then this solution gives you the most print performance for your
                  time and your buck. Or at least, that's my guess."

                  Moving the motors to the anchors is self-evident for anyone wanting to scale up Hangprinter.
                  For example, Open Source Ecology had this on their Hangprinter wiki page already on December 17, 2017:

                  Open Source Ecology seemed to think that Hangprinter was already used for for 3d printing of buildings.
                  They also believed that "Keep Motors on the anchor stations" was a prerequisite for a minimal viable product.

         <h2>What About the Guy Wires?</h2>
         <p>
                  The patent in question describes guy wires going from the D-anchor (high-up) anchor down to the ABC-anchors (base stations)
            with tension in them to pull
                  the D-anchor downwards and outwards in at least three directions and hence stabilizing the D-anchor.
                  See, for example, lines 36 in Fig 4 from their patent, near the top of this web page.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We have never used the terms "guy-wire" or "suspension wire" much in the Hangprinter community.
                  However, we've had lines going between the D-anchor and the lower anchors, just like guy wires would, since April 2017.
                  See, for example, the video posted at the top of this article or this image published on December 7, 2017:

         <p>
                  Although Hangprinter's guy wires are rerouted to transmit motion forces to the end effector,
                  these lines also do similar guy-wire pulling as the guy wires mentioned in the patent do.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Some might believe that the SkyBAAM's guy wires would be different because they would have constant tension.
                  But in fact, the SkyBAAM's guy wires would not have constant tension during operation.
                  The tension in the SkyBAAM's guy wires would vary greatly depending on variation in the pulling force from above and
            depending on
                  the end effector's position at any given time.
                  Let me explain.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The SkyBAAM's end effector connects to the D-anchor (highest anchor), where the guy wires are also connected.
                  Any force in the D-wires going to the end effector will have to be canceled by opposite forces from the crane and the
            guy wires
                  to keep the top anchor stationary.
                  Forces from the D-lines will be changing all the time during operation.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Hangprinter's guy wires also experience changing tension depending on the end effector's position,
                  but there will be some tension in them at all times during operation.
                  So even though it might look like Hangprinter doesn't need guy wires, it does have them as part of its dual-purpose
            line routing configuration (in its most common version 3 embodiment).
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The conceptual difference between the SkyBAAM's guy wires and Hangprinter's guy wires is only superficial
                  if there's any difference at all.
                
         </p>
         <h2>But The <i>Adjustable</i> Guy Wires Then? What About Them?
         </h2>
         <p>
                  From the patent in question:
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  "The guy-wires 36 can be adjustably extended from the cable winders 38 and retracted back on the cable winders 38."
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  This quote, combined with assumed adjustability of the crane's top wire length, means that "some embodiment of" the
            SkyBAAM might have a top anchor that
                  is as movable in 3d space as its end effector (or maybe even more movable if that embodiment happens to have the stationary
            end effector
                  feature described in the patent, but again, let's assume that's not the case).
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The patent in question patent, therefore, covers the idea of a nested Hangprinter, or in other words, "one Hangprinter
            inside another".
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  That is, a Hangprinter that has its high anchor point attached to another Hangprinter's end effector.
                  That sounds like a delightful combination of useless and incredibly inventive to me.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  However, the Hangprinter community had already discussed this exotic idea publicly before the patent's filing date:

         <p>
                  No. Hangprinter has always been "build a frame if you need one".
                  What we did (and still do) at trade shows and such was the most basic and cheap thing, a tetrahedron out of two-by-twos:

                       This image shows a common way of hoisting Hangprinter top anchors: block and tackle.
                       Alex Benz published it
                       <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/hangprinter/posts/298865100623656/">on December 22, 2017</a>.

         <p>
                  Getting the high anchor up is a very situation-dependent problem that Hangprinter users need to solve for themselves,
            which is why it's not included in the Hangprinter documentation.
                  Surprisingly, the most obvious one ("use a crane") is the only one to have gotten patented so far.

         <h2>But The UHMWPE Wires Then? Does Hangprinter Have Them?</h2>
         <p>
                  Yes. Hangprinter has never used anything else.
                  See, for example, this <a href="https://www.appropedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clerck,_a_RepRap_3D_printer_hanging_from_the_ceiling&amp;oldid=318273#Costs">Bill Of Materials List from December 9, 2015</a>.

                  Ok, so we've been having some fun looking at the hardware.
                  Since we possess an ordinary skill in the art of cable-driven robotics and 3d printing,
                  we know that we also need to look at source files and firmware.
                
         </p>

                  We must dive deeper and ask questions like:

                  Those are high numbers for a cable-driven robot.
                  The 49 forks mean that at least 49 people have copied Hangprinter's source files
                  as the basis for their own cable-driven robot builds.

                  The license in the repo allows and encourages such copying.

                  Although the patent doesn't mention kinematics transforms in detail, I will go through Hangprinter's briefly here
                  to make the case that Hangprinter could do a superset of the effector movements that the authors describe in the patent.

                       These are the most important equations in the Hangprinter firmware,
                       in <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/blob/c9295eceff474d44da9f7ad971b1a9f0303fea45/firmware/Marlin/Marlin/Marlin_main.cpp#L1843">their exact form the way they were on April 10, 2018</a>.
                       We see here that Hangprinter calculates its desired line lengths by using Pythagoras' theorem on all its cable directions.
                       The D-anchor's x- and y-coordinates are omitted from the calculation because they are defined to be zero.
                       However, the A, B, and C-anchors' coordinates could be any values.
                       Therefore, adding "a plurality" of new anchor points to the firmware straightforward.
                       You use Pythagoras' theorem once for every anchor you have, irrespective of how many anchors there are.
                       The Hangprinter firmware had other advanced features at the time, like "<a href="https://torbjornludvigsen.com/blog/2017/#hangprinter_project_29">spool buildup compensation</a>", but
                       let's stick to the basic principle of Pythagoras' theorem for this discussion.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  Therefore, the anchors can be placed at arbitrary positions around the print volume, and adding more of them is easy.
                  Adding pure "tension control" lines requires no firmware changes at all.
                
         </p>
         <h2>But The SkyBAAM Moves Its Lower Anchors Upwards During Print. How Could Hangprinter Do That?</h2>
         <p>
                  Yes.
                  We touched upon this subject earlier, but let's explain how Hangprinter's firmware supported this.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  See the gcode <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/blob/c9295eceff474d44da9f7ad971b1a9f0303fea45/firmware/Marlin/Marlin/Marlin_main.cpp#L1499">M665 in the firmware</a>.
                  A Hangprinter operator can use it during print to configure new anchor locations.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The values of <code>anchor_A_z</code>, <code>anchor_B_z</code>, and <code>anchor_C_z</code> in the code excerpt above
                  describe the z-positions of the three typically lower placed anchors (the A-, B-, and C-anchors).
                  These three values and all the other anchor position values, can be changed mid-print, with M665,
                  as evidenced by the widely covered 2017 tall tower print.

                  All of these firmware features were <a href="https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/pull/9180#issuecomment-380536959">being merged into the world's most used 3d printer firmware at the time</a>,
                  called Marlin Firmware, in a public merge thread (similar to a forum thread) that was open for anyone.
                  This means Hangprinter was becoming an integrated and widely available type of 3d printer at the firmware level at the
            time before April 13, 2018.

                  A comment on the changes required to make low anchors move continuously upwards during print.
                  Please refer to the source code figure above to understand what I'm talking about here.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The three terms similar to <code>sq(anchor_ABC_z - cartesian[Z_AXIS])</code> would need to be swapped out with a constant value.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The three new motors, those lifting the ABC-anchors, let's call them Q, P, and R, would get their new positions calculated
            like this:
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  <code>delta[Q_AXIS] = cartesian[Z_AXIS]</code>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Making the anchor movements continuous is a minimal change to the kinematics.
                  It is already in commercial use in February 2022; see <a href="https://en.bloft.fi/">bloft.fi</a> (not prior art).

                  Another way of "lifting anchor points continuously during operation" that was prior art on the patent's filing date
            is to span up a giant 2d frame, like this:

         <h2>But The Balloon Idea? The Authors Mention Swapping The Crane For A Balloon In The Text. Can They Keep That Idea For Themselves?</h2>
         <p>
                  It's a fun idea, but they are not the first to describe it.
                  It has been discussed in the Hangprinter community.
                  However, the Hangprinter Community wasn't first either.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The idea is evident to anyone with ordinary skills in the art of parallel robotics.
                  It's even described in textbooks about parallel robotics:

                  SkyBAAM shares the first half of its name with three pre-existing and very similar robots:
                  
            <ul>
                       
               <li>SkyDelta (2013),</li>
                       
               <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skycam&amp;oldid=827979277">SkyCam (the 1980s)</a>,
               </li>

            </ul>
                  These are similar to SkyBAAM in both name and implementation, and all of them are unreferenced in the patent.
                  It is necessary to Google up similar terms before choosing a project name like SkyBAAM to avoid name collisions.
                  Therefore, I find it unlikely that the patent authors didn't know about the above three projects when filing the patent.

                       Instead, they use four high anchors.

         <p>
                  I think every person following news channels covering 3d printing
                  would have heard about Hangprinter on April 13, 2018, including its obvious potential to scale up.
                  All these people know that Hangprinter is open source.
                  They know they can use Hangprinter however they like.
                  They also know nobody can patent Hangprinter or any other open source hardware project.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I'm happy to observe that <a href="https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/open-source-advocates-ornls-skybaam-3d-printer-copying-earlier-hangprinter-technology-203278/">central inventors in the 3d printing industry say that Hangprinter could be used to invalidate the patent</a> (not prior art).

         <h3>Why I Wrote This Prior Art Presentation</h3>
         <p>
                  I think the patent in question covers well-known and established know-how and some demonstrably obvious and frequent
            ideas from the period before the filing date.
                  Nothing in the patent fulfills the criteria of being non-obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art of cable-driven
            robotics or 3d printing, not now, and not during the period before the filing date.
                  In short, I think patent US 11230032 should be withdrawn or invalidated.

         <h2>Appendix</h2>
         <h3>Safety Concerns</h3>
         <p>
                  First of all, the telescoping flagpole (Fig 3 in the patent in question) is a dangerous approach, given its considereable
            risk of falling over.
                  Apart from damaging health and property, it would hurt Hangprinter's reputation
                  in the same way as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/8ah96r/anet_a8_burns_down_half_the_house/">self-igniting commercial clones hurt the reputation of Prusa and other RepRaps</a> (not prior art).
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The mobile crane with its arm over the Colosseum also risks falling over very quickly.
                  Something like what's shown in Fig 3 in the patent in question should never be built in practice.
                  Please consider safety before scaling up Hangprinter.
                
         </p>
         <h3>A More Sensible Approach To Designing Anchor Points For Construction Work With Hangprinter. Alternative To SkyBAAM's Single
            Crane And Telescoping Flagpoles
         </h3>
         <p>
                  A better base station would be any old mobile crane since they're already available and not restricted to purely vertical
            motion.
                  Why not a <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/5-Ton-5000kg-5T-diesel-engine_1600139278974.html">$23000 electric spider drive crane?</a> (not prior art),
                  or a simpler <a href="https://aguidepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Smittybilt-Winch-A-Best-Car-Trailer-Winch-1024x476.jpg">car winch size</a> (not prior art) for smaller jobs?
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Maybe the most practical thing would be three or four (or even more) spider crane-like vehicles lifting the D-anchor
            together,
                  with their lifting arms connected at a single high point, forming a polyhedron shaped like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron#Related_polyhedra_and_compounds">regular pyramid</a> (not prior art).
                  The lift arms would not have to be very stiff because of the self-supporting properties of pyramid shapes.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The spider crane-like vehicles could also have cable winches on board, close to the ground level.
                  If their lift-arms were, in fact, telescoping or foldable linear rails,
                  then the lower anchor points could slide up along the crane-arm-rails during operation if necessary
                  to avoid suspension cables potentially interfering with the unfinished 3d print.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Simple attachment points along the crane arm would be simpler and easier to implement.
                  Blocks at several attachment points could reroute lower (ABC) suspension cables.
                  Such rerouting would require manual intervention and maybe manual lifting during operation.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The crane-arm-rails or attachment points along the crane-arm would increase the stiffness requirements on the crane-arms
                  considerably and should be made optional or be limited to a low enough max height not to risk the crane-arm breaking
            during operation.
                
         </p>
