      Early last year, I learned of a comprehensive new Hangprinter patent.
      I decided to go after it, as it made community members nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got lots of help.
      I found an awesome lawyer and we presented prior art to the USPTO.
      The broad claims were then rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to save some straws of their patent, the holders narrowed their claims.
      They were pushed to cover just a narrow design path,
      on top of the publicly available Hangprinter base design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, they chose to own an inferior, uninspiring path that should be avoided anyways, for technical reasons.
      Trivial workarounds exist otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we have won, in the sense that we can forget about the whole thing.
