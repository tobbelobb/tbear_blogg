         <div class="date">3-10-2021</div>
         <p>
            In earlier texts I've linked open source to warm fuzzy feelings, freedom, and happiness.
            Critique often comes in terms of survival of the developer, food on the table, and such.
            So I've been thinking about the survival of open source devs.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  With "open source" in this text, I mean the practice of sharing intellectual work
                  down to excruciating detail.
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/so_open_source.png">
                       <img src="./bilder/so_open_source.png" alt="" width="500" height="150">
                     </a>
                  
            <figcaption>
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  The level of sharing is of course a continuum, and "open source" has many definitions.
                  In this text, let's associate "open source" with the most sharing end.
                
         </p>
         <h3>Finding Harmony</h3>
         <p>
                  Many open source developers want to be at the most sharing end, but struggle to make
                  ideals and survival line up.
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/harmony.jpg">
                       <img src="./bilder/harmony_liten.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281">
                     </a>
                  
            <figcaption>
                       Lining up internally makes you strong and stable.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  Finding such harmony while sharing means working on projects that:
                  
            <ol>
                       
               <li>Have to be open source in order to survive</li>
                       
               <li>Help the creator survive</li>
                     
            </ol>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I find nr 1 hard to crack,
                  but nr 2 really breaks my brain.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  That's partly because survival was always hard.
                  Look at the history or anything, and you'll find hardship and randomness.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But it's also because being open source limits some options.
                  You want money?
                  Open source is a terrible business plan.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  As an open source developer I need to think through some strategies.
                  Some things that could help the creator survive.
                
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                       Open source developers are often compared with stamp collectors.
                       So unfair.
                       Stamp collection is a real job.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <h3>Strategy 1&#65039;&#8419;: Politics</h3>
         <p>
                  This first one is a toy example.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Society as a whole could make a broad bet on open source.
                  We could fund some good open source projects with tax money.
                  Or we could force companies that misbehave on the closed
                  market to open source their products.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I think the open source community should be a bit worried about this one.
                  Open source devs filter out bad projects and let most of them die.
                  Policians in meeting rooms maybe wouldn't.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We'll get a bad rep if low quality open source projects doesn't die quickly.
                  Open source as an idea could go down like a burning zeppelin.
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/burning_zeppelin.jpg">

                       There was a time when techies pushed for zeppelins.
                       Big disasters scared the public away from the idea.
                       Mixing open source with politics could have us look a bit like this.

         <h3>Strategy 2&#65039;&#8419;: Fence In</h3>
         <p>
                  This second one is a common idea, so I'll explore it in some depth.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Let's generalize "fence" as
                  anything that separates insiders from outsiders.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The basic idea:
                  Somebody builds a fence around open source work.
                  If those on the inside survive happily, then more will join.
                  Once everyone is inside, we're all open and good.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The upside is that we don't have to make a society wide bet to try this strategy.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  However, if we get a few of these open islands, or don't get everyone onboard,
                  then we're stuck in half-open source land.
                  That's the downside.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Here follows a list of common fencing suggestions.
                  They are put in order of increasing distance
                  from the naive free-for-all strategy that I wish in my dreams would work.
                
         </p>
         <h4>&#129338;Fence 1: Private Donations and Grants</h4>
         <p>
                  It's simple and helps creators survive.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But givers are few, and there are no profits to re-invest.
                  We need something more.
                
         </p>
         <h4>&#129338;Fence 2: Licenses</h4>
         <p>
                  Copyleft licenses force devs to copyleft their work if it builds upon copyleft code.
                  It has been in use for 36 years, but few are currently joining.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The grass inside the fence needs to be made greener for us to survive there.
                
         </p>

            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <h4>&#129338;Fence 3: Insurances and Law Firms</h4>
         <p>
                  To improve the status inside the copyleft fence, we could hire lawyers.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  A law firm could take on large companies in court.
                  Insured open source creators could be enjoy legal security and stability.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Uninsured creators could be protected by proactive law firms who
                  actively search for license breakers, sue them,
                  and split infringement compensations with rights holders.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Alas, most open source devs aren't keen on punishing anyone.
                
         </p>
         <h4>&#129338;Fence 4: Insider Mentoring and Treasury</h4>
         <p>
                  Availability of learning resources and tools is what currently recruits
                  every single programmer to be an open source developer initially.
                  When people leave open source, it's most often for "food-on-the-table" reasons.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Some contact with a more experienced open source developer
                  would help many to stay in open source for longer.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  At this point in the list, pooling up some funds in a treasury
                  would be preferable.
                  Otherwise, the mentor would donate time.
                  Relying on a few expert individuals who have
                  the capacity to donate time is what we're trying to move away from.
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/Treasure_Island_Book.png">
                       <img src="./bilder/Treasure_Island_Book_liten.png" alt="" width="500" height="281">
                     </a>
                  
            <figcaption>
                       It's sometimes golden to have some guidance.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <h4>&#129338;Fence 5: Insider Trade Agreement</h4>
         <p>
                  Nice prices inside the fence could boost survival rates.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  However, it only works if some closed source businesses still buys the insiders' stuff.
                  We can't be too aggressive with pricing schemes, or it will backfire.
                
         </p>
         <h4>&#129338;Fence 6: Union of Open Source</h4>
         <p>
                  Only let good open source creators in.
                  Make them help each other survive.
                  All other fencing techniquies could be
                  strengthened by an organization that we all pay for together.
                  Deployed carefully, a union is a turbo for any kind of worker's conditions, including paychecks.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Making it float is a tad complicated.
                
         </p>
         <h4>&#129338;Fence 7: Pooling Patents</h4>
         <p>
                  Inside something like a union, we could pool our patents and enforce them together.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  With enough resources, we could create a service where outsiders could buy restricted
                  access to our work.
                  On our way to open source utopia, we could get rich!
                  Survival with style, right?
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  These kinds of strategies are risky.
                  Rent seekers could hi-jack the open source union.
                  They would then own the treasury, all patents,
                  copyrights, trade agreements, law firm contacs, and mentorship programmes.
                
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                       Do we wan to orbit a burning union sun?
                       Sounds a bit too warm and cozy to me.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  I don't really think we should fence in that much.
                  I think it's an arrogant idea.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Non-open companies are already specialized in surviving competition.
                  Playing by their rules will drag us into their game.
                  We can't beat them and have virtue at the same time.
                  We're great, but I don't think we're that superior.
                
         </p>
         <h3>Strategy 3&#65039;&#8419;: Survive In Self-Made Niches</h3>
         <p>
                  We're looking for strategies to help the creators survive.
                  To do better, let's stop treating open source like a broken business plan.
                  It's not a business plan.
                  It's more like a culture.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  One strategy is to not tie our culture to anything inside the current system.
                  Rather stay fluid, develop our culture in the background, and wait
                  patiently for break throughs.

                  Open source can go where others can't.
                
         </p>
         <h4>We Can Skip Licensing</h4>
         <p>
                  We can skip licenses on our open source work.
                  We can ignore copyright and law enforcement altogether.
                  That's one less burden.
                
         </p>
         <h4>We Can Skip Self Censoring</h4>
         <p>
                  We can be vulgar, political, and personal if we like to.
                  We can dive into the big wastes of time that people still want.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We can risk saying what we feel.
                  We can do anonymous things and provocative things.
                  Like jokes.

         <h4>We Can Create Art</h4>
         <p>
                  We can do computer generated art,
                  and art robots.
                  It's perfect for us!
                  If art ever scales, it looses value.
                  Companies must scale, so they can't do art.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We can play with all forcibly low volume things.
                  Not just low in demand.
                  I mean we can make few copies by design.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We can talk to whoever we want and collaborate with whoever we want.
                
         </p>
         <h4>We Can Hide</h4>
         <p>
                  Carving out and hiding within a niche where
                  closed source can't follow
                  will help an open source developer survive on the sharing end.
                
         </p>
         <h3>Strategy 4&#65039;&#8419;: Hibernate</h3>
         <p>
                  Surviving is about taking opportunity when there is one,
                  and saving energy if there's none.
                  Maybe there are few opportunities around right now.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  One can always do something else for a while,
                  or cut down on expenses.
                  We can pause.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  This strategy makes sense if you're think an asteroid event will
                  come and make place for more open source culture soon.
                  It could be one of these:
                
         </p>

         <h4>&#9732;&#65039;A Mass Layoff</h4>
         <p>
                  Those happen from time to time, and developers get it too.
                  Many will turn to cool open source culture if it exists,
                  full time or as a hobby.
                
         </p>
         <h4>&#9732;&#65039;A Digital Divide</h4>
         <p>
                  Western and Chinese tech are increasingly being made incompatible
                  for military strategic reasons.
                  Closed source have to choose sides.
                  Open source doesn't.
                  Having foothold on both sides makes open source more valuable
                  relative to the one-sided closed source.
                
         </p>
         <h4>&#9732;&#65039;A More Open Web</h4>
         <p>
                  The way browsers download javascript code in clear text
                  has already made javascript the most vibrant open source community.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The next web is being built on blockchains.
                  Regulations are currently forcing these blockchains to be open and distributed.
                  If it continues, the next web will become a gigantic open-only zone.
                
         </p>
         <h4>&#9732;&#65039;A Modernized Democracy</h4>
         <p>
                  Today algorithms make important decisions in our society,
                  and a few powerful people control them.
                  It's reasonable to expect democratic control over the code in the future.
                  Representatives will vote on what code gets deployed and what doesn't.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  To learn about the code,
                  people must be able to see it,
                  so it must be open source.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  This style of governance is commonplace in the cryptocurrency world.
                  If proven effective over time, companies and governments will copy parts of crypto's
                  governance structures.
                
         </p>
         <h4>&#9732;&#65039;The Mother of All Scandals</h4>
         <p>
                  Scandals already drive a lot of open source adoption,
                  and there's no reason to believe they have subsided.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Facebook and Google might come down like burning zeppelins
                  if their services go down, if their data leaks, or if it's used for evil.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Data collection is also happening in China.
                  Scandals that scare people are possible there as well.

         <h4>&#9732;&#65039;Closed Source Funds Dry Up</h4>
         <p>
                  For the past 50 years closed source technology has been good investments.
                  So investors have created closed source jobs.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We don't know if that trend will continue.
                  Tech giants have stopped emerging.
                  That's understandable, since yesterday's new names still haven't made any money.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Uber and Snapchat are still loosing billions per year, after 13 and 12 years in the red.
                  Will they ever pay down their debts?
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  What's appearing instead of new tech giants are crypto projects.
                  Hundreds of them.
                  They're typically very profitable and all open source.

                  Universal basic income has been suggested and piloted since forever.
                  If it became reality, open source would thrive even more.
                  The tens of years you spent building a CV that would give you a job that would put food on the table,
                  they would be in vein.
                  You could have been doing open source all that time.

         <h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
         <p>
                  The future is a volatile place, and a bet against open source might be
                  as irrational as a bet in favour.
                  Building a portfolio takes time, and it's too late to be early
                  when everybody wants in.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Hangprinter is a bet that some day, some time in the future,
                  people will look up from their phones and care about their physical lives again.
                  And then they will want to use their hands and manufacture.

         <p>
                  To be honest, sharing my brain on the web is what makes me what I am,
                  and I don't know how to stop.
                  There's been food on my table all my life.
                  I would have uploaded that to the web too if I could.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Maybe I know too little about death to know about survival.
                  I know nothing about starvation.
                  To my comfort, my critics don't either.

                  I'm thinking about what's next.
                  Do I want to become a kit maker?
                  Maybe sell big machines, or prints?
                  Print houses? Rockets?

                  To get down to what I want, we must rewind the tape a little bit.

         <h4>Getting Propelled</h4>
         <p>
                  I was already hooked on an idea.
                  I wanted to make a robust and distributed worldwide network of manufacturing.
                  Peer to peer.
                  The image above looked like an indication that it could happen.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  It was a very frequent idea at the time, ca between 2011 and 2016, and lots of people were working on it.
                  Reference for example the Wikipedia entries on
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_manufacturing">Distributed manufacturing</a>,
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production">Commons-based peer production</a>,
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">Peer to peer</a> and  for context.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Distributed Production. A New System</h4>
         <p>
                  Central to the idea is eliminating thresholds for newcomers.
                  Easy access.
                  Anyone can join and become an independent manufacturer.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Also central is ease of replication.
                  Anyone can easily help anyone else become an independent manufacturer.

                       One group is both a receiver and a supplier.
                       Making enough groups fill both roles at once is key in establishing a distributed network.

                  The ethos of distributed production was copied from free/open source software, and from the Internet itself.
                  We had achieved universal access to information and publishing in the preceding decade.
                  Now was the time to achieve universal access to goods and manufacturing.

         <h4>Star Shaped Networks are Easy and Rewardning, but Unfair and Fragile</h4>
         <p>
                  Let's zoom out a little bit.
                  Humans generally organize in star shaped networks, where the central node is very special.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Allowing for special treatment of central nodes helps star shaped networks off the ground.
                  The prospect of ending up in center themselves motivates people to build stars around them.
                  The star shape is also good for making quick decisions, critical in chaos and early phases.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Although easy to build, star networks can be fragile and unfair in the long run.
                
         </p>

                       Only star leaves everyone disconnected when one single node goes down: The Center Node.
                       The star's center has leverage on everyone else.

         <h4>Distributed Networks Considered Desirable</h4>
         <p>
                  Democracies have moved away from the star shape in their power and politics,
                  to avoid the risks of authoritarianism.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  When designing the Internet, the US military avoided the star shape.
                  Its center would have been too easy to attack.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Democracy and the Internet have become very popular.
                  Many like, and even idealize, their robustness/stability as well as
                  their percieved low threshold, equality, and fairness.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Distibuted Networks Are Hard To Create And Maintain</h4>
         <p>
                  Distributed networks have few ways to reward its early creators.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  In the cases of the Internet and of free sofware, it would undermine
                  the projects' fundamental goals to give anyone special treatment.
                  Being non-owned and distributed, there were no stock options to hand out.
                  (Before tech giants appeared, but let's not go there yet.)
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Harder yet: these networks had to recruit new, independent drivers of the network.
                  A single group can not be a distributed network all by themselves.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Even still harder:
                  All networks gravitate towards star shape.
                  It's what people are used to, its easy to build, it's short-term efficient.
                  A gravitation towards star shape should always be expected.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  With few ways of reward, why did anyone work on such hard projects at all?
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Many of them called themselves activists.
                  In this simplified recollection, I will use that term for all of them.
                  The Internet and free software were built by activists.
                  They were eager to build something better than star shape, even at a personal cost.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Strong forces was put in place to counter act the gravitation towards star shape.
                  For the Internet, it was automation (egalitarian protocol executed by computers).
                  For free software and democracy it was law (copyleft, with its threat of punishment).
                  Keeping a non-star network topology in check required such clever and quite ad-hoc solutions.

         <h4>Distributed Production Requires Humans Who Require Rewards</h4>
         <p>
                  It's questionable whether non-star ideals could be automated inside a manufacturing network back in 2011.
                  Terms of Internet communication are agreed upon by computers.
                  Terms of RepRap manufacturing were, and still are, agreed upon and executed by people.
                  We can automate a lot, but not the people parts.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The free software movement's use of the law to keep the non-star topology in check
                  has generally fallen out of favour.
                  People dislike threats of punishment.
                  We don't want to punish.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  So people must be rewarded.
                  Otherwise, they do something else.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Duplicating Internet's topology template within manufacturing requires more automation, or more reward
                  to be present within the network than outside of it.
                  It sounds hard.
                  But we tried anyways.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  For me, it was like this: I wanted to be useful.
                  If accepting lower rewards made me more useful then, well ok then.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Hard and complex work was done under umbrellas such as RepRap, Arduino, and Open Source Hardware.
                  Code and design files were maintained and improved.
                  Plans were crafted and executed upon.
                  Manifestos were written.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  There were some Distributed Production success.
                  The first image in this blog post convinced me that it was real.
                  In fact, RepRaps were printed forward at least in the thousands, maybe in the millions,
                  before more centralized brands and companies took over, and made the once distributed
                  network of RepRaps more familiarly star shaped.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The same star shape was given to the Internet by tech giants around the same time.
                  Centralization of the RepRap network was maybe even faster than that of the Internet.
                  RepRap was centralized by the very earliest RepRap activists themselves.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Fencing In</h4>
         <p>
                  Predictably, at the center of star shaped networks,
                  tired creators are currently building fences around their work.
                  The vast majority of open source projects have become star shaped networks.
                  Also those who try to be distributed networks.
                  See Nadia Eghbals book for numbers on this.
                  The gravitation towards star is stronger than any individual or company can overcome on their own.
                  And we're not collectively building distributed production right now.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Having followed the activist track for a few years, creators typically need more stability and rewards.
                  Patents, strict copyright licenses, and secretive development practices give stability and rewards.
                
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                       It's nice to have a fence sometimes.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  No one blames a fading activist.
                  Everyone wish them all the best.
                  Competitors, customers, and myself included.
                  Even as production is tamed and locked into star like shapes,
                  we should not call for distribution at any cost.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  In the fading activist's wake, we find a richer commons (from early years, and through doors left open), and awesome
            products,
                  retro-fitted into centralized manufacturing.
                  No low threshold network, but old gems and happy customers.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Giving Up on Distributed Production?</h4>
         <p>
                  Since I started working towards distributed production, I feel the manufacturing commons has plateaued, but at a higher
            level.
                  I enjoy the hights we've reached. I feel grateful, even as
                  we gravitate back into star shaped organizations.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But I can't help but think we're lowering our ambition by fencing in.
                  We got half way towards an Internet-like manufacturing network,
                  then rolled back to the old system.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We have achieved a manufacturing increment, still not a manufacturing revolution.
                  We're not automating, we're not winning. I feel like we're retiring. We're tired.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I probably won't become a kit maker.
                  I want to make a distributed production network.
                  Hangprinter is too star-like already.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  If I offer kits, and solve user experience issues,
                  then I sink deeper into the middle of the Hangprinter star shape.
                  I will get tired, and start building fences in there.
                
         </p>
         <h4>The Next Leap</h4>
         <p>
                  Zooming back in on the present again.
                  I think I know what to do next.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Blockchain projects, with their cryptocurrencies are a more fruitful attempt att duplicating the Internet's ideals and
            success.
                  It is cyberpunk flavoured free software money, squeezed into the Internets own design template.
                  Made by unknown activists towards whom we should be grateful.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  They are protocols of rewards.
                  Automated rewards.
                  Non-activists stay on the the network, and keep their computers on the network, because of the rewards.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  As mentioned earlier in the text,
                  distributed production needs more automation and rewards.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Let's try again, starting at the other end.
                  Let's design protocols for decentralized manufacturing.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Let's reward manufacturing efforts with tokens.
                  Let's introduce a blockchained manufacturing network, capable of representing and transferring real value.
                  As real as the objects we make.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Let's create oracles who measure and quantify what we do, and what we could do.
                  Let's get the data out. Transparently, on chain.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Let's build a treasury owned by the network itself.
                  Let's govern it on chain, according to our own protocol.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We can't shoot objects through Internet cables.
                  But we can shoot more things through them than we could before.
                  Deals, rights, rewards, money, commitments, contracts, designs, plans, hopes, dreams, and progress.
                  Let's try.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  What do we have to win?
                  Well, all the objects we'll make.
                  We want to make things.
                  We want the money.
                  We want the pride.
                  We want the craftmanship.
                  Manufacturing, baby!
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  And I think freedom.
                  A place in society.
                  Resilience.
                  Owning ourselves more.

                  The HP4 has done ca 75 hours of printing now, and shown great promise!
                  I shouldn't be surprised that it's working well, given the insane amount of

                  However, there's one thing that bothers be a bit.
                  The lines already show slight signs of wear.
                  I want to run HP4 unattended for thousands of hours.

                  I first tried filing down the surfaces of the bearings of the most frayed lines,
                  to see if the rate of fraying slowed down.

                   Interestingly, the bearing on the right, where some colourant from the line has filled up "gaps" in the 3d printed surface
               of the bearing, like grease,
                   did not fray the line nearly as much.

                  The result above called for experiments with line lubrication.
                  So I tested to rub one line with stearin, just from a room tempered chunk.
                  It seems to have stopped the fraying from gettning worse from what I can see.
                  I've also greased up one of the lines with some "multi grease" that I had lying around.
                  That also seems to have mitigated the issue.

         <p>
                  But even if my unstructured experiments with stearin and grease might have worked out,
                  I don't particularly like having to lubricate my lines.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  From the results above, I don't know for sure if it is the bearing surface, the sharp bearing radius, or maybe the white
            ceramic eyelet that
                  causes the line to fray. But I'm making some guesses.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Since my sanding of bearing surfaces didn't immediately reduce the fraying by a lot, I'll let that potential cause rest
            for now.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I know that the previous Hangprinter v4 prototype also had fraying issues, but it didn't use eyelets at all.
                  It frayed due to shear forces between lines and angled entrances to the vgroove bearings.
                  That's why the new prototype has tilted bearings, so the line always can enter them in a straight line.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I think the ceramic eyelets probably contributes to the problem,
                  but I think there must be other factors contributing as well.
                  There are some line guiding bearings on the ceiling unit, with no ceramic eyelets.
                  The line shows some very slight frying around those, which can't be explained by
                  wear from ceramic eyelets.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  So something else must be contributing, and let's believe/assume/hope for a while that
                  shear forces are already mostly dealt with.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Based on those preferences, experiences, beliefs, and hopes, it is clearly time to test if bigger bearing sizes could
            be helpful.

         <h3>What Has Been Done and What Has Not Been Done</h3>
         <p>
                  All other cable driven robots I've seen out there have bearings that rotate freely around an axis.
                  Only Hangprinter has insisted on stationary snails.
                
         </p>

            <figcaption>An old OpenScad experiment where I designed something similar to a standard industrial rotating block
                       for Hangprinter. It was never tested in practice because it was both complicated, and at the same time
                       needed to become even more complicated for it to rotate correctly.
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  The reason for this is that the line coming from the ceiling comes at a constant angle into the
                  snail.
                  If the bearing rotated freely, it would not point directly towards the effector, it would point
                  halfway between the effector and the ceiling unit.
                  Except, there exist at least two tricks one could use to design around that problem.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Trick 1</h4>
         <p>
                  We could let the line from the ceiling enter the "snail" in a particular way,
                  so that all forces from that entrance goes through the desired axis of rotation:
                  o
                
         </p>

            <figcaption>Forces acting on the line roller anchor we used last year.
                       The trick is to reduce the black line labeled "Distance = d" to a length of zero,
                       so the ceiling bound line doesn't create any rotational momentum on the snail.
                       So the whole block would rotate around the cross, and the ceiling bound line would enter
                       the snail via a freely rotating bearing that always points towards the ceiling,
                       and lines up with the cross.
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <h4>Trick 2</h4>
         <p>
                  If the snail's bearing had two axes to rotate around, then any entrance direction could be matched up with any
                  exit direction of the line, without any shear forces on the line.
                
         </p>

                  <a href="./bilder/rotating_rotating_block.png">

            <figcaption>Standard industrial rotating block with added rotational axis.</figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  Both of these tricks seem ok-ish as solutions to the fraying problem.
                  They're both not the most complicated mechanics in the world, but they add a significant amount of moving parts.
                  There are six of these snails in every Hangprinter.
                  If we count the line guides on the ceiling unit as well, since they do a similar job, there are 18.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Good bearings are expensive, and each will fail after X hours.
                  Before failing, they will start asking for lubrication, with squeeking and rattling sounds.
                  Not the end of the world, but we're trying to reduce price and maintenance burdens here.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The thought of implementing those tricks make my thoughts wander back to the good old days,
                  when Hangprinters were barely working, but extremely simple.

               and
                       it didn't allow tightening the lines individually.
                       Other than that, this solution was fantastic and unproblematic.
                       Lines were carried on the effector itself, so there was no entry from the ceiling unit.

                       surface finish though, and at least one Hangprinter v2 crashed into the floor because a D line had been frayed and
               snapped.
                       That's how D lines got bearings first.

         <p>
                  We're moving towards what other cable driven robots have been doing since forever, right?
                  Why do we do it so slowly?
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Hangprinter is searching the design space at the cheaper end of cable driven robotics.
                  None of the other cable driven robots have become wide spread either, so we
                  can't copy/paste or do "the obvious" while we're searching for new obviouses.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  There must be some deliberate searching on our end if we're to reach our goals.
                  I wish we could search a bit faster though, but alas.

         <h3>The Software</h3>
         <p>
                  People hate Software.<br>
                  Bugs, leaks, errors.<br>
                  Cryptic messages.<br>
                  Work-arounds.<br>
                  Menus, forms, and help-pages.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Software says "Ok, doing it".<br>
                  And you wait, you don't know how long.<br>
                  You don't know what it's doing.<br>
                  You <i>need</i> it to work.<br>
                  It sometimes fails. After a while.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Like the most under-funded government agency imaginable.<br>
                  Broken windows, rotten apples, full trashcans everywhere.<br>
                  People defend themselves.<br>
                  Against software.<br>
                
         </p>
         <h3>The Plastic</h3>
         <p>
                  People hate plastic.<br>
                  Weak, cheap, poison.<br>
                  Awful smell, cracking sounds, hysterical colors.<br>
                  Short use.<br>
                  Long trash.<br>
                  Buries us, in lifeless artificiality.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Whatever disease you get,<br>
                  there's always a chance<br>
                  that plastic,<br>
                  disturbing your hormones<br>
                  triggered it.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  That's what people feel.<br>
                  Plastic comes from an unknown place, underground.<br>
                  Plastic poison can penetrate your skin.<br>
                  Get into your body.<br>
                  Like the devil.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  All other materials are natural.<br>
                  Only plastic is not.<br>
                  People defend themselves.<br>
                  Against plastic.<br>
                
         </p>
         <h3>The Robots</h3>
         <p>
                  People abhor most robots.<br>
                  Plastic and software with motors.<br>
                  Commanded by others.<br>
                  In our surroundings.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The few robots that people love,<br>
                  are exactly those<br>
                  that they control,<br>
                  themselves.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Other robots steal.<br>
                  Grab attention.<br>
                  Grab pictures, writings, and videos.<br>
                  Robots intrude.<br>
                  Take jobs.<br>
                  Take lives.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Robots make money.<br>
                  For the already rich.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Robots are<br>
                  the ultimate source<br>
                  of faceless power.<br>
                
         </p>
         <h3>The Future</h3>
         <p>
                  A single person<br>
                  with superior robots<br>
                  could subjugate all other humans.<br>
                  All you need is scale.<br>
                  This risk was not in the past,<br>
                  but is in the future.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  A group of countries<br>
                  or companies<br>
                  or countries and companies<br>
                  with superior robots<br>
                  own the world.<br>
                  That's the present.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  People must defend themselves.<br>
                  Against robots.<br>
                  And the only way<br>
                  is with robots.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The power over yourself,<br>
                  can stay yours in two ways:<br>
                  through kindness of others,<br>
                  who have robots,<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Or you can have robots yourself.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  People who hate software<br>
                  who hate plastic<br>
                  who have little money<br>
                  will stumble into non-ownership of robots.<br>
                  Through defending themselves<br>
                  against software and plastic.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  They must be given ownership,<br>
                  or they will be owned.<br>
                  Or worse:<br>
                  Irrelevant.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  They need free robots.<br>
                  They need to be handed their free robots.<br>
                  For free.<br>
                  Extremely friendly robots.<br>
                  Easy robots.<br>
                  Entirely under their command robots.<br>
                  But strong and valuable robots.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Robots that they will accept.<br>
                  Robots that will eventually defend <i>them</i>.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But people hate robots.<br>
                  And receive robots with stiff smiles.<br>
                  Least wanted pair of socks, on Christmas Day.<br>
                  Hangprinter is me, knitting socks.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I hate software and plastic.
                  But I need Robots.
                  And also you.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Just my kindness,<br>
                  will not be enough to cover all,<br>
                  when robots of power march in.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  They will call it,<br>
                  "economic realities",<br>
                  and do what they want.<br>
                  They will harm you only by accident.<br>
                  Because they won't notice you at all.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But if you have robots.<br>
                  A few for yourselves,<br>
                  that you love.<br>
                  Then you can step aside.<br>
                  Not care about those in power.<br>
                  And be free.<br>

         <p>
                  I saw this
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EuWCFCgy58">talk</a>
                  about one of my favourite artist's creative process.
                  Here are a few quotes from it that I've resoned around the last few days:
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  1: <i>"Publishing is not finishing. All the emotions are different. [...] Publishing is deciding to stop when you want to keep working.
               And it's super painful."</i>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  2: <i>"Publishing works best if you think of it as a style of working. It's an attitude that persists throughout the entire creative
               process.
                       Working to publish is about getting shit done. Your whole mentality shifts when you're working to publish. You focus
               on the stuff that matters,
                       and you ignore the stuff that doesn't."</i>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  3: <i>"Working to publish, it's selfless, it's outward focused, it's about results, and giving back, and contributing to the world."</i>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  His shortest version of the good work to publish method is this:
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  4: <i>"... doing only what matters, the whole time, and then stopping."</i>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  He explains that this is a great strategy because most ideas and attempts flop, and you don't know which will succeed
            beforehand.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  5: <i>"You can't choose what you're famous for. ... I can't make a song a hit.
                       I can't control how my songs are pushed through the world and are experienced by others.
                       What I can do is be prolific, I can be creative, I can make great stuff.
                       What I can do is work to publish.
                       You write the next scene, you record the next instrument, you build the next set, you shoot the next tape, you design
               the next synth,
                       and I can </i>[publish all that]<i> and then I can move on, and I can go to sleep at night, knowing that I did everything I could."</i>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I want to see if this musician's points can help me think better about where to take hp-mark and Hangprinter from here.
                  His work is different from my work, but we're also similar.
                  Let's see if we can make our experiences fit.
                
         </p>
         <h3>1: Publishing Is Not Finishing</h3>
         <p>
                  Things are never finished, we have that in common.
                  I like his emotion focused description.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  With where I'm at with hp-mark right now, I don't want to keep working.
                  So we're not exactly at the same spot, the musician and I.
                  That's because hp-mark is not like a song. It's more like an instrument.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Since even before starting to build hp-mark, I've thought of it as lifting Open Source Hardware over a threshold,
                  closing the loop, ending the guessing game in open source hardware positioning.
                  A short-term grind, a long-term investment for the common good.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Proprietary machines have had motion tracking for decades.
                  Everyone knows an OSHW motion tracker could be made.
                  It just requires someone's work hours.
                  That might as well be me, I thought.
                  But it's not very fun, no, and I knew that.
                  It's painful to continue.
                  It will be delightful to stop.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  My hp-mark process changes after this month's demo, because hp-mark is good enough.
                  I have improved both code and hardware a lot, and tested it thoroughly over the last month.
                  It can take OSHW over the threshold just fine, if it reaches widely.
                
         </p>

         <h3>2: Working to Publish</h3>
         <p>
                  The musician and I have different outputs and different metrics.
                  For music, success is to reach people.
                  hp-mark needs to
                  
            <ul>
               <li>reach people, and to</li>
               <li>work well enough for them,</li>
            </ul>to be successful.
                  My pain comes from ignoring/failing at the former while working to my bones on the latter.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But the musician's point makes a lot of sense for hp-mark in the continuation.
                  Just make a small thing and see if it flies.
                  See if you can have a little success, quickly.
                  I will get back to that way of working.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Make something small work well enough, then try to reach people.
                  Make something else work then try to reach people again.
                  And again and again and so on.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I regret not pasting a giant Aruco marker on the Hangprinter back in November 2020.
                  I could also have dropped the spherical markers in December, when I found they were hard to make/source.
                  And the colored markers stayed with me for too long also.
                  I would have reached more collaborators and supporters by doing something simple,
                  and then spent time reaching out instead.
                  Imperfect decisions there. Well, well.
                
         </p>
         <h3>3 and 4 are Mostly the Same</h3>
         <p>
                  I think quotes 3 and 4 mostly come down to the
                  same improvement of process for hp-mark as quote 2 did:
                  
            <ol>
                       
               <li>Make a small thing.</li>
                       
               <li>See if it flies.</li>
                     
            </ol>
                
         </p>
         <h3>5: Torbjorn Tests New Things</h3>
         <p>
                  I interpret quote 5 as "test new things, test different things, do the next thing".
                  The last couple of Hangprinter years have felt a bit stagnant.
                  Particularly on the outreach side of things. Why?
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Many worthwhile Hangprinter related projects are hard and time consuming.
                  Robustness is not quick, easy, cheap, or sensational.
                  We need robustness.
                  So I had to dive into "doing it right", and swam across the swamp.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Still, I should have done it more
                  quick, easy, cheap, and sensational than I did.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  There's always a light version of any project, one that breaks you down less.
                  I must break down less. Economically and motivationally.
                
         </p>
         <p>

         <div class="date">27-3-2021</div>
         <p>
                  The rabbit hole has gotten deeper.
                  But progress is fast at this stage.
                  Average error (that's accuracy) has shrunk from ca 35 mm to ca 3.5 mm.
                  Maybe even smaller.
                  I haven't tested accuracy thoroughly yet.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Precision (that's stability of repeated measurements) at the origin is down from ca 5 mm to ca 1 mm.
                  And also:
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  CHECK!<input type="checkbox" checked disabled>Detect all markers on 95% of training images<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The markers have changed from small colored spheres to bigger retro-reflective disks.
                  They're cheaper, lighter, easier to manufacture, and perform much, much better.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I had to go and implement the disk geometric equations.
                  My body protested for days when I picked up that task.
                  Luckily, this time I had a
                  <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-24672-5_41.pdf">research paper</a>
                  to guide me through most of the theory,
                  and I could quickly replicate my old test structure.
                  This made me ca 10x faster compared to when I did the sphere geometry.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I've posted a couple of demos since last time:
                
         </p>
         <figure>

         </figure>
         <p>
                  The first video shows the more fundamental use case for hp-mark: auto/assisted anchor calibration.
                  It enables all other hp-mark use cases, including homing.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  So hp-mark is growing up.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The extremely high recognition and identification rate I have now is thanks to some LEDs
                  that I put around the camera:
                
         </p>
         <figure>

            <figcaption>My picam v2 with two rings of in total 20 LEDs around it.
                       This removes most problems I had with shadows disturbing measurements.
                       I'd say it took identification rate from ca 95% to ca 99%(?).
                       Out of ca 1000 test images, I haven't recorded a single identification failure yet.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  I know I could enhance accuracy and precision further by mounting these slightly higher end, low distortion lenses:
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/low_distortion_lenses.jpeg">
                       <img src="./bilder/low_distortion_lenses_liten.jpeg" alt="A set of low distortion lenses" width="500" height="281">
                     </a>
                  
            <figcaption>A set of low distortion lenses that I ordered from Arducam.
                       This setup would use the same image sensor, wire connection, and software interface as the current Picam v2.
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  However, changing the camera PCB and lens means having to calibrate it and also make a new mounting bracket for it.
                  Plus all the fiddling with wires, focusing the camera, unexpected stuff etc.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  My guess is 1-2 days of work.
                  Is it worth it? What are my goals?
                
         </p>
         <h3>Keep Your Head Down And Work!</h3>
         <p>
                  This sprint's goal is "high accuracy auto calibration".
                  The higher level goal is "a reliable work horse".
                  Peace of mind.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The better camera achieves all of that.
                  So I have to do it.
                  Just like I redid the markers.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  This isn't how I worked a few years back.
                  This isn't how the HP1, HP2, HP3, and first prototype of HP4 were made.
                  They were all just barely working systems.
                  This is why HP4 will be different.
                
         </p>
         <h3>AAAAAAA!</h3>
         <p>
                  Body is shouting loudly.
                  And for good reason.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Rest of World, aka everyone I meet, care extremely little about hp-mark
                  in its current form.
                  It you're reading this blog post, you're among very few
                  (<a href="https://torbjornludvigsen.goatcounter.com/">source</a>).
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  As much as I crave attention, Rest of World craves brain tickle.
                  Humans need this always.
                  Brains want to light up.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Current form hp-mark just isn't very...

                  ... stimulating.
                  For me, a person who is constantly dying for attention, this is a problem.
                
         </p>
         <h3>What To Do</h3>
         <p>
                  Even at nanometer precision, hp-mark without a context would be nano-stimulating to the non-Hangprinter owning world.
                  Common solutions to this kind of problem:
                  
            <ol>
                       
               <li>Pay folks to suffer thruogh your under-stimulating thing. Attention-as-a-service. Day jobs. Ads. This is the most common solution
                  out in the wild.
               </li>
                       
               <li>Find people who love your stuff by unusual amounts.</li>
                       
               <li>Put your thing into an exciting context/story.</li>
                       
               <li>Pitch! Learn pitching dark arts.</li>
                       
               <li>Accept defeat.</li>
                     
            </ol>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  All of these have their own pros and cons.
                  Too much to write down here.
                  I will do number 5 for the rest of this sprint, and then try my luck at number 3.

         <p>
                  The first slightly more exciting context, at least for hp-mark, will be HP4.
                  End-to-end, released machine, with build manual and all.
                  I look forward to that.
                
         </p>
         <h3>Outlook</h3>
         <p>
                  HP4 is not very interesting on its own either though.
                  It will need it's own number 3 eventually.
                  A context creates a story.
                  Without a story, humans can not understand, or hardly even percieve your stuff.
                
         </p>
         <h3>Number 3 Suggestions for HP4</h3>
         <ul>
                  
            <li>
                       Hangprinting a body shaped house that's later sold as an art piece on a blockchain.

                       Perfect for Burning Man.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       Using HP4 as a motorized trampoline for cats. Computer vision detects cat. Ejects/bounces cat. Cat happy. The end.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       A Hangprinter v4 built... inside Minecraft. And then being sold as an NFT on a blockchain. Just add the blockchain
               to the end of every suggestion from here on.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       A Hangprinter with AI that registers its own company, and prints and assembles an array of other machines to be its

            </li>

                       A Hangprinter mounted upside-down. So D-anchor is on floor, ABC-anchors in ceiling, and print surface is in the ceiling.
                       Mounted sideways would also work, for hype purposes, but not very well in practice.

         <h3>Short End Note</h3>
         <p>
                  The old HP story is basically "a living thing that creates economic value".
                  Fully automated, self-replicating, printing furniture, taking zero space when not in use.
                  I'm not sure if that is tickly enough from my attention cravings' perspective.
                  Before it's even out there we'll never know.

                  I climbed down a rabbit hole recently.
                  Nearly half a year working on hp-mark.
                  The past 84 days even skipping blog post and newsletter writing.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Progress has been steady.
                  It works now.
                  <a href="https://gitlab.com/tobben/hp-mark">hp-mark</a> measures positions, like:

                  Accuracy is not fantastic.
                  The image above is a lucky one, with only 3 mm of error.
                  A more commonly seen error is around 35 mm.

                  A lot of hp-mark work remains.

                  I chose C++, OpenCV, and a very traditional approach for this project.
                  I just wanted the most basic code that would mecanically find circles among pixels,
                  and then apply static geometric equations to transform circles into a nozzle position.
                  No AI stuff, no GPU stuff, no fancy hardware control, just
            $$
              f(x) \rightarrow y,
            $$
                 where \(x\) is an image, and \(y\) is a nozzle position.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Such an old and explored problem!
                  I felt confident.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Some things that took long for me to program, in descending order:
                  
            <ul>
                       
               <li><b>Good enough ellipse detection.</b> OpenCV's <code>SimpleBlobDetector</code> was ok, but ultimately not
                            robust enough for our purposes. I was lucky to find <a href="https://github.com/CihanTopal/ED_Lib">ED_Lib</a>, and spent a little over a month integrating it into hp-mark.
                            For example, I had to fight a little to get sub-pixel accuracy in the center and size data. More about that
                            <a href="https://github.com/CihanTopal/ED_Lib/issues/12">here</a>.
               </li>
                       
               <li><b>Geometry.</b> A photon bounces off a sphere, through a pinhole, and onto an image sensor. Many more follow.
                            They create a pattern, a projection, on the image sensor.
                            Given the position of the sphere, what's the equation of its projection? Or vice versa; given a projection,
                            what's the position of the sphere? Which projected point correspond to the sphere's center? I derived all relevant
                  equations by hand and wrote tests that wouldn't go
                            green before I was exactly right.
                            To bootstrap the chain of testable geometric functions, I derived the most basic equation in two different
                            ways, and tested that the two derived functions gave exactly the same results.
                            The system would never be good if the theory it rested upon wasn't sound, so I spent the time to make this
                            perfect.
               </li>
                       
               <li><b>Filtering among ellipses.</b> The improved ellipse detector found <i>lots</i> of ellipses.
                            Getting hp-mark to determine which ellipses represent real markers, was hard.
                            To  be real useful, hp-mark must be able to identify all its markers almost all the time,
                            so I spent extra time here as well. I will return to this point in the future, but we're at least finding
                            all the markers ca 80% of the time now.
               </li>
                       
               <li><b>Color recognition.</b> The human brain is full of heuristics that helps us determine color,
                            in a wide variety of situations. Very fine details of camera settings, light/shadow,
                            and way of definition, throws a simplistic computer program off very easily.
                            The strongest heuristic I was able to program, in which all colors are relative, still can not
                            identify a non-marker in a set of six real and one false marker.
                            Still, I was able to keep color as a marker categorizer that lets us
                            avoid having to put QR-codes on our markers.
                            I fought a bit for the aesthetics.
                          
               </li>
                     
            </ul>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I feel like I'm almost too tired of it to even write about this stuff now.
                  But before I climb out of this rabbit hole,
                  I can show you something about how the ellipse detector works internally:
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/input3.png">

         </figure>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/segmentImage3.png">
                       <img src="./bilder/segmentImage3.png" alt="segment image inside ellipse detector" width="500" height="407">

            <figcaption>The edge pixels are the grouped into segments. Each segment has a different color in this visualization.
                       A single segment that forms a closed circle or ellipse will be detected already at this stage.
                       Most detectors can find complete closed-curve ellipses quickly and easily.
                       What sets ED_Lib apart is how hard it tries to piece together the chopped-up circles, and how quick and cheap
                       it manages to do this.

                       (If you compare very closely with the segments image, you find that not all arcs match exactly.
                       They should match exactly.
                       I mixed up images from two different runs when preparing this, so this arc visualization is ever so slightly off.
                       It's still representative for the result below though, in that the top blue marker could not be found amog these arcs
               either, but all other markers were found.)

         </figure>
         <p>
                  In the image above, we see that one marker was missed, despise ED_Lib's many different heuristics.
                  I tried to tune the heuristics for the hp-mark use case.
                  See how that went, <a href="https://github.com/CihanTopal/ED_Lib/issues/13">here</a>.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Ultimately failing to tune the heuristics convinced me to put background plates below my markers.
                  That is what I'm currently working on.
                  They will probably end up looking something like this:
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/octagon.jpeg">

            <figcaption>Test of marker background with bent octagonal background.</figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  The final background design will probably be flat and circular, and hp-mark will use the edge of the
                  background, as well as the marker itself, to determine its position, further improving both robustness and accuracy
            of the system.

         <p>
                  But not today.
                  I'm so tired of that kind of programming.
                  Let's celebrate the results at the top of this post for a while first.
                  And let's rest.
