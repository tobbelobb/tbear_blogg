         <div class="date">3-10-2021</div>
         <p>
            In earlier texts I've linked open source to warm &amp; fuzzy feelings, freedom, and happiness.
            Critique often comes in terms of survival, food on the table, and such.
            So I've been thinking about open source and survival.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  With "open source" in this text, I mean the practice of sharing intellectual work
                  down to excruciating detail.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The level of sharing is of course a continuum, and "open source" has many definitions.
                  In this text, let's associate "open source" with the extreme open end of the continuum.
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/so_open_source.png">

            <figcaption>
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  Doing open source requires survival.
                  Survival does not require doing open source.
                  All of our ancestors survived without it.
                  Most people alive right now have ever needed to share intellectual work publicly.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Linking open source to survival would rationalize it.
                  Even the weakest of links to the longest term macro level survival would help.
                  Failing to rationalize would make open source a useless hobby altogether.
                
         </p>

                       Stamp collectors are nice people. Yet, they don't expect much appreciation for their work.
                       Do we deserve it any more than them?
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <h4>No History, No Rationale</h4>
         <p>
                  New technology enables new levels of sharing.
                  The ability to publish entire commercial products for free consumption
                  has been around for only 40 years or so.
                  We are the first ones to try this out.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Therefore, it makes sense for society to just shrug at open source.
                  Sit and wait.
                  See how things pan out.
                  Nobody owes any appreciation to open source people.
                  Not until open source gets relevant to the survival of things they care about, in a way they can understand.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We've seen a few open source projects grow and thrive.
                  They're all extraordinary exceptions, based on harsh initial sacrefice.
                  They're un-repeatable gems, enabled by unique talent and timing.
                  Sometimes unreal grit and loads of ad-hoc solutions.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I'm thinking about Bitcoin, Ethereum, Red Hat, Mozilla, Linux, Wikipedia,
                  Arduino, RepRap, gcc, llvm, the wild javascript ecosystem, and so on.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  They've all painstakingly carved out previously unimaginable niches.
                  They have not survived in an orderly fashion.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Still, many do open source because it feels right, or they "believe" in it.
                  Feelings and beliefs in themselves don't tell us much though.
                  For example smoking and drinking "feels right" to many.
                  And some believe in Santa.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Betting on What Feels Right</h4>
         <p>
                  Open source then is either self destructive entertainment, or it is a bet.
                  Rationalizing open source requires betting that it will turn out good for survival in the long run.
                  It's much like ideology or religion.
                  If an ideology makes people behave survive-ish, then it's a rational ideology.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  It's fascinating that people make such bets, on what's long term survive-ish and what's not.
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/betting.jpg">
                       <img src="./bilder/betting_liten.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375">
                     </a>
                  
            <figcaption>
                       So you think open source is good for us? How do you know?
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <h4>The Benefits of the Doubters</h4>
         <p>
                  If you believe open source would improve society at your cost,
                  then you get the choice between survival and virtue.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Many in this group feel squeezed.
                  If they choose virtue, they might get wrecked.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  If they choose survival they have more options.
                  For example, they could manage to change their beliefs about open source
                  at any time in the future.
                  In that case they will get out of the squeeze unharmed.
                  Voila.
                
         </p>
         <h4>The Burdens of the Believers</h4>
         <p>
                  Some are useless at getting away from old beliefs.
                  They are stuck in the squeeze.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Let's see if these people can find harmony, a rationale.
                  Let's see if their survival and ideals can line up with one another.
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/harmony.jpg">
                       <img src="./bilder/harmony_liten.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281">
                     </a>
                  
            <figcaption>
                       Lining up internally makes you strong and stable.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  For open source idealists to find harmony, they must find projects that
                  
            <ol>
                       
               <li>Have to be open source in order to survive</li>
                       
               <li>Help the creator survive</li>
                     
            </ol>
                  Bitcoin is a prime example of the first point.
                  A closed source Bitcoin would be short lived.
                  Bitcoin therefore has it's open source-ness linked to it's survival-ness.
                
            <p>
                   
            </p>
                  Bitcoin is a bad example of the second point.
                  I don't think I would have survived trying to create Bitcoin.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I find the first point hard to crack.
                  But it's the second one that breaks my brain.
                
         </p>
         <h3>Help The Creator Survive: 4 Strategies</h3>
         <h4>Strategy 1: Politics</h4>
         <p>
                  As a society, we could make a collective bet on open source.
                  We could identify a few desireable projects that must be open source,
                  and then pay creators with tax money.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I doubt the political wizardry required to make it happen exists.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  A cheaper way to make the collective bet, could be through punishment.
                  Companies that misbehave on the closed market could be forced to open source their products.
                  Even open source non-believers could plausibly accept that.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  This could be comfortable for the individual open source creator.
                  However, apart from the non-believers' obvious concerns,
                  open source should be a bit worried about its own survival as well here.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Squeezed open source devs filter out bad projects.
                  Policians in meeting rooms maybe wouldn't.
                  Imagine the bad rep open source would get if the very lowest quality open source projects didn't die quickly.
                  Think worse than today. Open source as an ideology could go down like a burning zeppelin.
                
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                       There was a time when thought leaders pushed for zeppelins.
                       After a few disasters, the public got irreversibly apalled at the idea.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <h4>Strategy 2: Fence In</h4>
         <p>
                  Let's use the word "fence" in a broad way.
                  Anything that separates "insiders" from "outsiders".
                  If those inside of an open source fence survive happily, then more will jump over the fence voluntarily.
                  Once everyone is inside, we're all open and good.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The downside to all fencing strategies is that
                  we get "half-open source", or "weakly-fenced-in source" instead of really open source at the start.
                  We might loose some credibility initially.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The upside is that we get around having to make a big society wide bet.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Here follows a list of fencing suggestions.
                  They are put in order of increasing distance from the naive free-for-all strategy that I wish in my dreams would work.
                
         </p>
         <h5>Private Donations and Grants</h5>
         <p>
                  Making others give by asking nicely is a great tactics.
                  It's simple and helps creators survive.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But givers are limited, and there are no profits to re-invest.
                  Grants are temporary, and most often just virtous self-suffering on the giver's end.
                  We need something more.
                
         </p>
         <h5>Copyleft</h5>
         <p>
                  Copyleft forces devs to copyleft their work if it builds upon copyleft code.
                  It has been in use for 36 years, and still nobody has gotten fat inside copyleft-land.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The grass inside the fence needs to be made greener for us to survive there.
                
         </p>

                       I'd rather not put such attributions under my figures. An attribution license forces me to. That's another weak fencing
               strategy.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <h5>Insurances and Law Firms</h5>
         <p>
                  A large enough law firm could take on very large companies in court, in ways that
                  individuals can't.
                  Insured open source creators would be enjoy more security and stability.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Uninsured creators could be protected by more proactive law firms.
                  These firms could actively search for license breaking products,
                  and split the infringement compensations with rights holders.
                
         </p>
         <h5>Mentoring</h5>
         <p>
                  At this point in the list, a common treasury outside of insurance firms would be preferable.
                  Otherwise, the mentor would donate time.
                  Relying on a few individuals who have
                  the capacity to donate is what we're trying to move away from.

         <h5>Insider Trade Agreement</h5>
         <p>
                  A big mutual agreement among many open source creators could give nicer prices among insiders.
                  This could boost survival rates inside the fence.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  However, it only works if some closed source businesses still buys the insiders' stuff.
                  We can't be too aggressive with pricing schemes, or it will backfire in a number of ways.
                
         </p>
         <h5>Union of Open Source</h5>
         <p>
                  Only let good open source creators in.
                  Make them help each other survive.
                  All other fencing techniquies could be strengthened by an organization that we all pay for together.
                  Deployed carefully, a union is a turbo for any kind of worker's conditions.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Making it float is complicated and carries risk.
                
         </p>
         <h5>Pooling Patents</h5>
         <p>
                  Inside something like a union, we could hire lawyers to help us pool patents, and enforce them.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  This might not sound like open source at all anymore.
                  It would be closed source to outsiders, and reach the effect of universally open source
                  once all of society is included in our union club.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But again there's risk.
                  Imagine if profit seekers hi-jacked the leadership of the open source union who owns patents,
                  copyrights, trade agreements, law firm contacs, and mentorship programmes.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Large portions of what's today open source could be closed in by a lip servicing union
                  who gets support from outside because it fixes the rough edges and user experience issues of open source projects
                  for example.
                  The horror.
                
         </p>

                       A burning union sun could create life in our open source fenced in universe?
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <h5>A Subscription Service</h5>
         <p>
                  If a strong open source union was successful, we would see
                  massive pressure from outsiders who wanted to access the union's code and designs.
                  If would also be massively tempting for those inside the fence to break the internal rules,
                  and sell out cheaply to closed-siders.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  One way to regulate those pressures could be to release a Spotify-like subscription service.
                  Outsiders get access to all open source stuff, but with extremely restrictive licenses,
                  if they pay a regular subscription fee.
                  Profits are distributed among creators based on downloads or some other metrics.
                
         </p>
         <h3>Rewind!</h3>
         <p>
                  I've drawn the line very long in this section about strategy 2.
                  Maybe to scare you a little.
                  Fencing in is not how open source beats closed source.
                  It's an arrogant idea.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Companies are already specialized for survival.
                  We can't beat everyone on their turf always, and have virtue at the same time.
                  We will look like any old company, just weighed down by more dogma.
                  They will wipe the floor with us.
                  Our creators will not survive.
                  Society won't cheer for us either.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Strategy 3: Survival Through Being More What We Already Are</h4>
         <p>
                  We have to see the problem from a different angle.
                  Open source is a different phenomenon than current company centric tech altogether.
                  We should build our new culture in the background,
                  and wait patiently for break throughs.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We are the little mammals in the age of dinosaurs.

                       Orretherium lived some 74-72 million years ago in South America. It shared its habitat with numerous dinosaurs including

         </figure>
         <p>
                  Open source should go and thrive where closed companies can't,
                  and wait for their eventual extinction event.
                  We should not try to force it.
                
         </p>
         <h5>We Can Skip Licensing</h5>
         <p>
                  We can skip licenses on our open source work.
                  We can ignore copyright and law enforcement altogether.
                  That's one less burden.
                
         </p>
         <h5>We Can Skip Self Censoring</h5>
         <p>
                  We can do outlandish things.
                  We can be vulgar, political, and personal if we like to.
                  We can dive into the big wastes of time that people still want.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We can do computer generated art.
                  It's perfect for us!
                  If art ever scales, it looses value.
                  Companies must scale, so they can't do art.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We can play with all forcibly low volume things.
                  Not just low in demand.
                  I mean we can make few copies by design, and then switch to next project.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We can do provocative things, and anonymous things.
                  Like jokes.
                  We can risk saying what we really feel.
                  We can be raw, real, new, natural, and unexpected.
                  We can bring in new people, new cultures, new kinds of crazy.
                
         </p>
         <h5>We Can Expect Hardship</h5>
         <p>
                  Startups, political parties, religions, all have chaotic, non-linear histories,
                  full of fighting and hardship.
                  No projects that matter are truly easy.
                  Expect open source projects to be complicated, or join stamp collectors and dinosaurs with whatevery they are doing.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Surviving is about taking opportunity.
                  There are few opportunities in open source now.
                  Search where companies can't go, and cling to every little opportunity you sense.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Open source isn't more survive-ish than that.
                  I'm kind of giving up on connecting open source with short term survival of the individual at this point.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Strategy 4: Wait</h4>
         <p>
                  In the longer run, we're making a bet by doing open source.
                  We won't win unless some even occurs that increases the importance of open source.
                  Like the asteroid that wiped out dinosaurs gave mammals a time to shine.

         <h5>Asteriod Events</h5>
         <h6>The Talent Pool</h6>
         <p>
                  Imagine when the public finally decides growth is the driving force
                  behind environmental destruction.
                  Imagine if work hours were shortened to limit bad outcomes.
                  What would people do instead?
                  Many would dive into open source hobbies.
                  Maybe it won't be so bad for open source to be a useless hobby after all.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Imagine a mass layoff within big tech.
                  An AI might out-compete big tech's staff programmers.
                  They'd get nice severance pays, and open source projects
                  would see a huge inflow of talent.
                  It's already happening. New AI driven programming tools pop up every month.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Imagine a digital divide between Western and Chinese tech.
                  Two different ecosystems of technology that is willfully made incompatible
                  for military strategic reasons.
                  The more military strategy got shoved into closed source devices, the more
                  valuable the open source ones would get.
                  Closed source would have to choose sides.
                  Open source would not.
                  It's already happening.
                
         </p>
         <h6>The Web of the Future</h6>
         <p>
                  Imagine if web browsers had to download javascript source
                  code in clear text to be able to make web pages dynamic.
                  It already happened.
                  It is why we have the big open javascript ecosystem.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Or imagine if most apps used public blockchains under the hood,
                  and that the blockchain projects required apps to be distributed
                  due to regulatory concerns.
                  This would outlaw closed source within big profitable niches.
                  It's already happening. The SEC is currently hunting down any big cryptocurrency
                  project deemed too centralized.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Or imagine if states and other big organizations imposed democratic
                  governance over which code bits get deployed, and which don't.
                  Political parties or organizational stakeholders would analyze a proposed piece
                  of code, and vote on whether it aligns with their values.
                  The code must be open for that to work.
                  It's already happening within hundreds of cryptocurrency projects.
                  If successful, companies will copy their governance structure.
                
         </p>
         <h6>The Public</h6>
         <p>
                  Or imagine that a truly huge privacy or it security scandal
                  brought down closed source companies' legitimacy like a burning zeppelin.
                  Imagine something even worse than manipulating elections and wire tapping everyone.
                  Imagine a scandal so grim that normal people's hearts and wallets itched.
                  Open source would go unscatched, and see inflows of users.
                  We've been getting drips of this for ten years already.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Westerners seem to think that the great social experiment of China's
                  all encompassing surveillance and reward system carries risk of
                  spinning out of control.
                  Too much power is concentrated in central points, which historically
                  made nations unstable in the West.
                  If that repeats itself in China,
                  then the unravelling chaos will increase demand for open source
                  alternatives.
                
         </p>
         <h3>If You Give Up On Open Source, You Also Give Up On Closed Source</h3>
         <p>
                  It seems like I can't strongly link open source with survival.
                  It seems more rational to keep one's options open in the short term.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  What I can do is to crack open any stone hard closed source convictions of yours, and pour some cold doubt in there.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We haven't gotten any new tech giants for 18 years.
                  Apple and Microsoft are 46 and 47 years old.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  If closed companies' survival strategies are better than open source's,
                  then why are those companies so rare?
                  It's because their strategy is to kill competitors.
                  It's unclear whether or not that helps society as a whole to survive in the long run.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Younger closed unicorn companies mostly loose a lot of money.
                  Uber (13 years old) loose ca $7 billion per year.
                  Snapchat (12 years old) loose ca $1 billion per year.
                  Tesla (18 yo) just recently broke even for the first time.
                  There's no guarantee that any of these will ever break even again.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I'm not impressed.
                  The public is not impressed.
                  It's hard to see any value being created either for themselves or for society at large.
                  It looks like these closed companies are little more than a useless and very expensive
                  hobby of wealthy investors trying to make history or something.
                  They look suspiciously unassociated with survival.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  And what are these companies doing, trying to survive, or maybe just break even?
                  They're downloading open source code, like everyone else, trying to glue
                  it together in creative ways and serve it with a shiny surface.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  It's not always appreciated, but the vast majority of code running
                  in modern computers, cars, and robots, is open source code.
                  99% of all software projects have open source dependencies.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Open source as a software development methodology has won.
                  It was winning when Google and Facebook based their businesses on open source two decades ago,
                  and it had been winning for many years before that already.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Open source software itself seems to survive better than closed source equivalents
                  by orders of magnitude.
                  Of course, since everyone wants it and can have it for free.
                  While open source creation is hard to rationalize, open source usage
                  is a walk in the park to rationalize.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The future is a volatile place, and a bet against open source might be
                  as irrational as a bet in favour of it.

                  HP4 works well enough for everyday use.
                  Tiny things remain. Like attaching a Z-probe.

         <p>
                  I'm thinking about what's next.
                  Do I want to become a kit maker?
                  Maybe sell big machines, or prints?
                  Print houses? Rockets?
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  To get down to what I want, we must rewind the tape a little bit.
                  It was one image in particular that propelled me into the Hangprinter project:

                  RepRaps have been spreading through a print-it-forward culture.
                  That's an unusual and awesome way for machines to spread.

         <h4>Getting Propelled</h4>
         <p>
                  I was already hooked on an idea.
                  I wanted to make a robust and distributed worldwide network of manufacturing.
                  Peer to peer.
                  The image above looked like an indication that it could happen.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  It was a very frequent idea at the time, ca between 2011 and 2016, and lots of people were working on it.
                  Reference for example the Wikipedia entries on
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_manufacturing">Distributed manufacturing</a>,
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production">Commons-based peer production</a>,
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">Peer to peer</a> and  for context.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Distributed Production. A New System</h4>
         <p>
                  Central to the idea is eliminating thresholds for newcomers.
                  Easy access.
                  Anyone can join and become an independent manufacturer.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Also central is ease of replication.
                  Anyone can easily help anyone else become an independent manufacturer.

                       This image shows some kind of transfers.
                       One group is both a receiver and a supplier.
                       Making enough groups fill both roles at once is key in establishing a distributed network.

         <p>
                  The ethos of distributed production was copied from free/open source software, and from the Internet itself.
                  We had achieved universal access to information and publishing in the preceding decade.
                  Now was the time to achieve universal access to goods and manufacturing.

         <h4>Star Shaped Networks are Easy and Rewardning, but Unfair and Fragile</h4>
         <p>
                  Let's zoom out a little bit.
                  Humans generally organize in star shaped networks, where the central node is very special.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Allowing for special treatment of central nodes helps star shaped networks off the ground.
                  The prospect of ending up in center themselves motivates people to build stars around them.
                  The star shape is also good for making quick decisions, critical in chaos and early phases.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Although easy to build, star networks can be fragile and unfair in the long run.
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/NetworkTopologies.png">

                       Only star leaves everyone disconnected when one single node goes down: The Center Node.
                       The star's center has leverage on everyone else.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <h4>Distributed Networks Considered Desirable</h4>
         <p>
                  Democracies have moved away from the star shape in their power and politics,
                  to avoid the risks of authoritarianism.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  When designing the Internet, the US military avoided the star shape.
                  Its center would have been too easy to attack.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Democracy and the Internet have become very popular.
                  Many like, and even idealize, their robustness/stability as well as
                  their percieved low threshold, equality, and fairness.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Distibuted Networks Are Hard To Create And Maintain</h4>
         <p>
                  Distributed networks have few ways to reward its early creators.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  In the cases of the Internet and of free sofware, it would undermine
                  the projects' fundamental goals to give anyone special treatment.
                  Being non-owned and distributed, there were no stock options to hand out.
                  (Before tech giants appeared, but let's not go there yet.)
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Harder yet: these networks had to recruit new, independent drivers of the network.
                  A single group can not be a distributed network all by themselves.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Even still harder:
                  All networks gravitate towards star shape.
                  It's what people are used to, its easy to build, it's short-term efficient.
                  A gravitation towards star shape should always be expected.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  With few ways of reward, why did anyone work on such hard projects at all?
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Many of them called themselves activists.
                  In this simplified recollection, I will use that term for all of them.
                  The Internet and free software were built by activists.
                  They were eager to build something better than star shape, even at a personal cost.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Strong forces was put in place to counter act the gravitation towards star shape.
                  For the Internet, it was automation (egalitarian protocol executed by computers).
                  For free software and democracy it was law (copyleft, with its threat of punishment).
                  Keeping a non-star network topology in check required such clever and quite ad-hoc solutions.
                
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                       Keeping a network decentralized is hard, like keeping drops of mercury apart.

         <h4>Distributed Production Requires Humans Who Require Rewards</h4>
         <p>
                  It's questionable whether non-star ideals could be automated inside a manufacturing network back in 2011.
                  Terms of Internet communication are agreed upon by computers.
                  Terms of RepRap manufacturing were, and still are, agreed upon and executed by people.
                  We can automate a lot, but not the people parts.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The free software movement's use of the law to keep the non-star topology in check
                  has generally fallen out of favour.
                  People dislike threats of punishment.
                  We don't want to punish.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  So people must be rewarded.
                  Otherwise, they do something else.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Duplicating Internet's topology template within manufacturing requires more automation, or more reward
                  to be present within the network than outside of it.
                  It sounds hard.
                  But we tried anyways.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  For me, it was like this: I wanted to be useful.
                  If accepting lower rewards made me more useful then, well ok then.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Hard and complex work was done under umbrellas such as RepRap, Arduino, and Open Source Hardware.
                  Code and design files were maintained and improved.
                  Plans were crafted and executed upon.
                  Manifestos were written.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  There were some Distributed Production success.
                  The first image in this blog post convinced me that it was real.
                  In fact, RepRaps were printed forward at least in the thousands, maybe in the millions,
                  before more centralized brands and companies took over, and made the once distributed
                  network of RepRaps more familiarly star shaped.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The same star shape was given to the Internet by tech giants around the same time.
                  Centralization of the RepRap network was maybe even faster than that of the Internet.
                  RepRap was centralized by the very earliest RepRap activists themselves.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Fencing In</h4>
         <p>
                  Predictably, at the center of star shaped networks,
                  tired creators are currently building fences around their work.
                  The vast majority of open source projects have become star shaped networks.
                  Also those who try to be distributed networks.
                  See Nadia Eghbals book for numbers on this.
                  The gravitation towards star is stronger than any individual or company can overcome on their own.
                  And we're not collectively building distributed production right now.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Having followed the activist track for a few years, creators typically need more stability and rewards.
                  Patents, strict copyright licenses, and secretive development practices give stability and rewards.
                
         </p>

            <figcaption>
                       It's nice to have a fence sometimes.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  No one blames a fading activist.
                  Everyone wish them all the best.
                  Competitors, customers, and myself included.
                  Even as production is tamed and locked into star like shapes,
                  we should not call for distribution at any cost.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  In the fading activist's wake, we find a richer commons (from early years, and through doors left open), and awesome
            products,
                  retro-fitted into centralized manufacturing.
                  No low threshold network, but old gems and happy customers.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Giving Up on Distributed Production?</h4>
         <p>
                  Since I started working towards distributed production, I feel the manufacturing commons has plateaued, but at a higher
            level.
                  I enjoy the hights we've reached. I feel grateful, even as
                  we gravitate back into star shaped organizations.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But I can't help but think we're lowering our ambition by fencing in.
                  We got half way towards an Internet-like manufacturing network,
                  then rolled back to the old system.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We have achieved a manufacturing increment, still not a manufacturing revolution.
                  We're not automating, we're not winning. I feel like we're retiring. We're tired.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I probably won't become a kit maker.
                  I want to make a distributed production network.
                  Hangprinter is too star-like already.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  If I offer kits, and solve user experience issues,
                  then I sink deeper into the middle of the Hangprinter star shape.
                  I will get tired, and start building fences in there.
                
         </p>
         <h4>The Next Leap</h4>
         <p>
                  Zooming back in on the present again.
                  I think I know what to do next.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Blockchain projects, with their cryptocurrencies are a more fruitful attempt att duplicating the Internet's ideals and
            success.
                  It is cyberpunk flavoured free software money, squeezed into the Internets own design template.
                  Made by unknown activists towards whom we should be grateful.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  They are protocols of rewards.
                  Automated rewards.
                  Non-activists stay on the the network, and keep their computers on the network, because of the rewards.

                  As mentioned earlier in the text,
                  distributed production needs more automation and rewards.

                  Let's try again, starting at the other end.
                  Let's design protocols for decentralized manufacturing.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Let's reward manufacturing efforts with tokens.
                  Let's introduce a blockchained manufacturing network, capable of representing and transferring real value.
                  As real as the objects we make.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Let's create oracles who measure and quantify what we do, and what we could do.
                  Let's get the data out. Transparently, on chain.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Let's build a treasury owned by the network itself.
                  Let's govern it on chain, according to our own protocol.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  We can't shoot objects through Internet cables.
                  But we can shoot more things through them than we could before.
                  Deals, rights, rewards, money, commitments, contracts, designs, plans, hopes, dreams, and progress.
                  Let's try.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  What do we have to win?
                  Well, all the objects we'll make.
                  We want to make things.
                  We want the money.
                  We want the pride.
                  We want the craftmanship.
                  Manufacturing, baby!

                  And I think freedom.
                  A place in society.

                  The HP4 has done ca 75 hours of printing now, and shown great promise!
                  I shouldn't be surprised that it's working well, given the insane amount of
                  work hours that I've put in, but I am.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  However, there's one thing that bothers be a bit.
                  The lines already show slight signs of wear.
                  I want to run HP4 unattended for thousands of hours.
                  So I need to stop any fraying.

         <h3>Experiments</h3>
         <p>
                  I first tried filing down the surfaces of the bearings of the most frayed lines,
                  to see if the rate of fraying slowed down.
                
         </p>

            <figcaption>The left one of these two bearings was sanded down, for a smoother and rounder surface, but its line kept fraying.
                   Interestingly, the bearing on the right, where some colourant from the line has filled up "gaps" in the 3d printed surface
               of the bearing, like grease,
                   did not fray the line nearly as much.
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  The result above called for experiments with line lubrication.
                  So I tested to rub one line with stearin, just from a room tempered chunk.
                  It seems to have stopped the fraying from gettning worse from what I can see.
                  I've also greased up one of the lines with some "multi grease" that I had lying around.
                  That also seems to have mitigated the issue.
                
         </p>

         </figure>
         <p>
                  But even if my unstructured experiments with stearin and grease might have worked out,
                  I don't particularly like having to lubricate my lines.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  From the results above, I don't know for sure if it is the bearing surface, the sharp bearing radius, or maybe the white
            ceramic eyelet that
                  causes the line to fray. But I'm making some guesses.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Since my sanding of bearing surfaces didn't immediately reduce the fraying by a lot, I'll let that potential cause rest
            for now.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I know that the previous Hangprinter v4 prototype also had fraying issues, but it didn't use eyelets at all.
                  It frayed due to shear forces between lines and angled entrances to the vgroove bearings.
                  That's why the new prototype has tilted bearings, so the line always can enter them in a straight line.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I think the ceramic eyelets probably contributes to the problem,
                  but I think there must be other factors contributing as well.
                  There are some line guiding bearings on the ceiling unit, with no ceramic eyelets.
                  The line shows some very slight frying around those, which can't be explained by
                  wear from ceramic eyelets.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  So something else must be contributing, and let's believe/assume/hope for a while that
                  shear forces are already mostly dealt with.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Based on those preferences, experiences, beliefs, and hopes, it is clearly time to test if bigger bearing sizes could
            be helpful.
                  Meet the "Snaily Snail" line roller anchor, with a 608 skate bearing in it:

         <h3>What Has Been Done and What Has Not Been Done</h3>
         <p>
                  All other cable driven robots I've seen out there have bearings that rotate freely around an axis.
                  Only Hangprinter has insisted on stationary snails.

            <figcaption>An old OpenScad experiment where I designed something similar to a standard industrial rotating block
                       for Hangprinter. It was never tested in practice because it was both complicated, and at the same time
                       needed to become even more complicated for it to rotate correctly.
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  The reason for this is that the line coming from the ceiling comes at a constant angle into the
                  snail.
                  If the bearing rotated freely, it would not point directly towards the effector, it would point
                  halfway between the effector and the ceiling unit.
                  Except, there exist at least two tricks one could use to design around that problem.
                
         </p>
         <h4>Trick 1</h4>
         <p>
                  We could let the line from the ceiling enter the "snail" in a particular way,
                  so that all forces from that entrance goes through the desired axis of rotation:
                  o

            <figcaption>Forces acting on the line roller anchor we used last year.
                       The trick is to reduce the black line labeled "Distance = d" to a length of zero,
                       so the ceiling bound line doesn't create any rotational momentum on the snail.
                       So the whole block would rotate around the cross, and the ceiling bound line would enter
                       the snail via a freely rotating bearing that always points towards the ceiling,
                       and lines up with the cross.
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <h4>Trick 2</h4>
         <p>
                  If the snail's bearing had two axes to rotate around, then any entrance direction could be matched up with any
                  exit direction of the line, without any shear forces on the line.
                
         </p>

            <figcaption>Standard industrial rotating block with added rotational axis.</figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  Both of these tricks seem ok-ish as solutions to the fraying problem.
                  They're both not the most complicated mechanics in the world, but they add a significant amount of moving parts.
                  There are six of these snails in every Hangprinter.
                  If we count the line guides on the ceiling unit as well, since they do a similar job, there are 18.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Good bearings are expensive, and each will fail after X hours.
                  Before failing, they will start asking for lubrication, with squeeking and rattling sounds.
                  Not the end of the world, but we're trying to reduce price and maintenance burdens here.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The thought of implementing those tricks make my thoughts wander back to the good old days,
                  when Hangprinters were barely working, but extremely simple.

               and
                       it didn't allow tightening the lines individually.
                       Other than that, this solution was fantastic and unproblematic.
                       Lines were carried on the effector itself, so there was no entry from the ceiling unit.

               snapped.
                       That's how D lines got bearings first.

                       Given the D-line accidents we had seen though, we knew that we would have to let simplicity fly, and and make
                       line guiding bearings part of our
                       Hangprinter lives.

            <figcaption>Also 2017: The first snails used U-shaped bearings with 4 mm bores, and PTFE tubes as eyelets.
                       We were halfway into sin with this one, and it had many problems. Lines fell off the bearing, the whole thing wiggled
               side to side,
                       and the PTFE tube wore down quickly.

            <figcaption>2018: A late HP3 lineroller to the right. Lines still fell off the bearing, but it wiggled less, could double the line,
                       and had no PTFE tube that could wear down. Unfortunately, the slimmer vgroove bearings increased shear forces on the
               line.
                       It was also easily broken if someone stepped on it by accident.
                       The early HP4 lineroller to the left only solved one of those problems. It was more sturdy, but it ate through FireLine
                       in only a few hundred hours.

         <h3>Hangprinter's Snaily Snail Slow Design Development in General</h3>
         <p>
                  We're moving towards what other cable driven robots have been doing since forever, right?
                  Why do we do it so slowly?
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Hangprinter is searching the design space at the cheaper end of cable driven robotics.
                  None of the other cable driven robots have become wide spread either, so we
                  can't copy/paste or do "the obvious" while we're searching for new obviouses.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  There must be some deliberate searching on our end if we're to reach our goals.
                  I wish we could search a bit faster though, but alas.

                  Hangprinter version 4 works now.
                  It is the default Hangprinter design in the repo.
                  It has some documentation, and it has some builders.
                  It prints decent quality things, like this:

         <div class="date">24-6-2021</div>
         <h3>The Software</h3>
         <p>
                  People hate Software.<br>
                  Bugs, leaks, errors.<br>
                  Cryptic messages.<br>
                  Work-arounds.<br>
                  Menus, forms, and help-pages.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Software says "Ok, doing it".<br>
                  And you wait, you don't know how long.<br>
                  You don't know what it's doing.<br>
                  You <i>need</i> it to work.<br>
                  It sometimes fails. After a while.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Like the most under-funded government agency imaginable.<br>
                  Broken windows, rotten apples, full trashcans everywhere.<br>
                  People defend themselves.<br>
                  Against software.<br>
                
         </p>
         <h3>The Plastic</h3>
         <p>
                  People hate plastic.<br>
                  Weak, cheap, poison.<br>
                  Awful smell, cracking sounds, hysterical colors.<br>
                  Short use.<br>
                  Long trash.<br>
                  Buries us, in lifeless artificiality.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Whatever disease you get,<br>
                  there's always a chance<br>
                  that plastic,<br>
                  disturbing your hormones<br>
                  triggered it.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  That's what people feel.<br>
                  Plastic comes from an unknown place, underground.<br>
                  Plastic poison can penetrate your skin.<br>
                  Get into your body.<br>
                  Like the devil.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  All other materials are natural.<br>
                  Only plastic is not.<br>
                  People defend themselves.<br>
                  Against plastic.<br>
                
         </p>
         <h3>The Robots</h3>
         <p>
                  People abhor most robots.<br>
                  Plastic and software with motors.<br>
                  Commanded by others.<br>
                  In our surroundings.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The few robots that people love,<br>
                  are exactly those<br>
                  that they control,<br>
                  themselves.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Other robots steal.<br>
                  Grab attention.<br>
                  Grab pictures, writings, and videos.<br>
                  Robots intrude.<br>
                  Take jobs.<br>
                  Take lives.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Robots make money.<br>
                  For the already rich.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Robots are<br>
                  the ultimate source<br>
                  of faceless power.<br>
                
         </p>
         <h3>The Future</h3>
         <p>
                  A single person<br>
                  with superior robots<br>
                  could subjugate all other humans.<br>
                  All you need is scale.<br>
                  This risk was not in the past,<br>
                  but is in the future.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  A group of countries<br>
                  or companies<br>
                  or countries and companies<br>
                  with superior robots<br>
                  own the world.<br>
                  That's the present.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  People must defend themselves.<br>
                  Against robots.<br>
                  And the only way<br>
                  is with robots.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The power over yourself,<br>
                  can stay yours in two ways:<br>
                  through kindness of others,<br>
                  who have robots,<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Or you can have robots yourself.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  People who hate software<br>
                  who hate plastic<br>
                  who have little money<br>
                  will stumble into non-ownership of robots.<br>
                  Through defending themselves<br>
                  against software and plastic.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  They must be given ownership,<br>
                  or they will be owned.<br>
                  Or worse:<br>
                  Irrelevant.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  They need free robots.<br>
                  They need to be handed their free robots.<br>
                  For free.<br>
                  Extremely friendly robots.<br>
                  Easy robots.<br>
                  Entirely under their command robots.<br>
                  But strong and valuable robots.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Robots that they will accept.<br>
                  Robots that will eventually defend <i>them</i>.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But people hate robots.<br>
                  And receive robots with stiff smiles.<br>
                  Least wanted pair of socks, on Christmas Day.<br>
                  Hangprinter is me, knitting socks.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I hate software and plastic.
                  But I need Robots.
                  And also you.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Just my kindness,<br>
                  will not be enough to cover all,<br>
                  when robots of power march in.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  They will call it,<br>
                  "economic realities",<br>
                  and do what they want.<br>
                  They will harm you only by accident.<br>
                  Because they won't notice you at all.<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But if you have robots.<br>
                  A few for yourselves,<br>
                  that you love.<br>
                  Then you can step aside.<br>
                  Not care about those in power.<br>
                  And be free.<br>

         <p>
                  I saw this
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EuWCFCgy58">talk</a>
                  about one of my favourite artist's creative process.
                  Here are a few quotes from it that I've resoned around the last few days:
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  1: <i>"Publishing is not finishing. All the emotions are different. [...] Publishing is deciding to stop when you want to keep working.
               And it's super painful."</i>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  2: <i>"Publishing works best if you think of it as a style of working. It's an attitude that persists throughout the entire creative
               process.
                       Working to publish is about getting shit done. Your whole mentality shifts when you're working to publish. You focus
               on the stuff that matters,
                       and you ignore the stuff that doesn't."</i>

                  I want to see if this musician's points can help me think better about where to take hp-mark and Hangprinter from here.
                  His work is different from my work, but we're also similar.
                  Let's see if we can make our experiences fit.
                
         </p>
         <h3>1: Publishing Is Not Finishing</h3>
         <p>
                  Things are never finished, we have that in common.
                  I like his emotion focused description.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  With where I'm at with hp-mark right now, I don't want to keep working.
                  So we're not exactly at the same spot, the musician and I.
                  That's because hp-mark is not like a song. It's more like an instrument.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Since even before starting to build hp-mark, I've thought of it as lifting Open Source Hardware over a threshold,
                  closing the loop, ending the guessing game in open source hardware positioning.
                  A short-term grind, a long-term investment for the common good.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Proprietary machines have had motion tracking for decades.
                  Everyone knows an OSHW motion tracker could be made.
                  It just requires someone's work hours.
                  That might as well be me, I thought.
                  But it's not very fun, no, and I knew that.
                  It's painful to continue.
                  It will be delightful to stop.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  My hp-mark process changes after this month's demo, because hp-mark is good enough.
                  I have improved both code and hardware a lot, and tested it thoroughly over the last month.
                  It can take OSHW over the threshold just fine, if it reaches widely.

         <h3>2: Working to Publish</h3>
         <p>
                  The musician and I have different outputs and different metrics.
                  For music, success is to reach people.
                  hp-mark needs to
                  
            <ul>
               <li>reach people, and to</li>
               <li>work well enough for them,</li>
            </ul>to be successful.
                  My pain comes from ignoring/failing at the former while working to my bones on the latter.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  But the musician's point makes a lot of sense for hp-mark in the continuation.
                  Just make a small thing and see if it flies.
                  See if you can have a little success, quickly.
                  I will get back to that way of working.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Make something small work well enough, then try to reach people.
                  Make something else work then try to reach people again.
                  And again and again and so on.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I regret not pasting a giant Aruco marker on the Hangprinter back in November 2020.
                  I could also have dropped the spherical markers in December, when I found they were hard to make/source.
                  And the colored markers stayed with me for too long also.
                  I would have reached more collaborators and supporters by doing something simple,
                  and then spent time reaching out instead.
                  Imperfect decisions there. Well, well.
                
         </p>
         <h3>3 and 4 are Mostly the Same</h3>
         <p>
                  I think quotes 3 and 4 mostly come down to the
                  same improvement of process for hp-mark as quote 2 did:
                  
            <ol>
                       
               <li>Make a small thing.</li>
                       
               <li>See if it flies.</li>
                     
            </ol>
                
         </p>
         <h3>5: Torbjorn Tests New Things</h3>
         <p>
                  I interpret quote 5 as "test new things, test different things, do the next thing".
                  The last couple of Hangprinter years have felt a bit stagnant.
                  Particularly on the outreach side of things. Why?
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Many worthwhile Hangprinter related projects are hard and time consuming.
                  Robustness is not quick, easy, cheap, or sensational.
                  We need robustness.
                  So I had to dive into "doing it right", and swam across the swamp.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Still, I should have done it more
                  quick, easy, cheap, and sensational than I did.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  There's always a light version of any project, one that breaks you down less.
                  I must break down less. Economically and motivationally.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Quick things to try:
                  
            <ul>
                       
               <li>Hangprinter with a very heavy effector</li>
                       
               <li>Hangprinter with big heat bed</li>
                       
               <li>Hangprinter with capable clay extruder</li>
                       
               <li>Hangprinter with two tool heads mounted</li>
                       
               <li>Hangprinter with as simple as possible tool changer</li>
                       
               <li>hp-mark with a GIANT marker</li>
                       
               <li>Outdoor Hangprinting</li>
                       
               <li>Collaboration with 3d-printing artists</li>
                       
               <li>Scripting auto calibration (easy now, after 7 months of grind :-P)</li>
                       
               <li>Load cells along lines</li>
                       
               <li>Store bought pellet extruder</li>
                     
            </ul>
                  Things that I don't yet know how to fit into the quick publish and outreach success template:
                  
            <ul>
                       
               <li>RepRapFirmware upgrade</li>
                       
               <li>Electronics (Duet Wifi to Duet 3) upgrade</li>
                       
               <li>Even more hp-mark precision and accuracy</li>
                       
               <li>Hangprinter v4 official release with documentation</li>
                       
               <li>More closed line guides, smaller bearings</li>
                     
            </ul>

         <p>
                  The rabbit hole has gotten deeper.
                  But progress is fast at this stage.
                  Average error (that's accuracy) has shrunk from ca 35 mm to ca 3.5 mm.
                  Maybe even smaller.
                  I haven't tested accuracy thoroughly yet.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Precision (that's stability of repeated measurements) at the origin is down from ca 5 mm to ca 1 mm.
                  And also:
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  CHECK!<input type="checkbox" checked disabled>Detect all markers on 95% of training images<br>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The markers have changed from small colored spheres to bigger retro-reflective disks.
                  They're cheaper, lighter, easier to manufacture, and perform much, much better.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I had to go and implement the disk geometric equations.
                  My body protested for days when I picked up that task.
                  Luckily, this time I had a
                  <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-24672-5_41.pdf">research paper</a>
                  to guide me through most of the theory,
                  and I could quickly replicate my old test structure.
                  This made me ca 10x faster compared to when I did the sphere geometry.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  I've posted a couple of demos since last time:
                
         </p>
         <figure>

         <p>
                  The first video shows the more fundamental use case for hp-mark: auto/assisted anchor calibration.
                  It enables all other hp-mark use cases, including homing.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  So hp-mark is growing up.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The extremely high recognition and identification rate I have now is thanks to some LEDs
                  that I put around the camera:
                
         </p>

            <figcaption>My picam v2 with two rings of in total 20 LEDs around it.
                       This removes most problems I had with shadows disturbing measurements.
                       I'd say it took identification rate from ca 95% to ca 99%(?).
                       Out of ca 1000 test images, I haven't recorded a single identification failure yet.
                     
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  I know I could enhance accuracy and precision further by mounting these slightly higher end, low distortion lenses:
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/low_distortion_lenses.jpeg">

            <figcaption>A set of low distortion lenses that I ordered from Arducam.
                       This setup would use the same image sensor, wire connection, and software interface as the current Picam v2.
            </figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  However, changing the camera PCB and lens means having to calibrate it and also make a new mounting bracket for it.
                  Plus all the fiddling with wires, focusing the camera, unexpected stuff etc.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  My guess is 1-2 days of work.
                  Is it worth it? What are my goals?
                
         </p>
         <h3>Keep Your Head Down And Work!</h3>
         <p>
                  This sprint's goal is "high accuracy auto calibration".
                  The higher level goal is "a reliable work horse".
                  Peace of mind.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  The better camera achieves all of that.
                  So I have to do it.
                  Just like I redid the markers.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  This isn't how I worked a few years back.
                  This isn't how the HP1, HP2, HP3, and first prototype of HP4 were made.
                  They were all just barely working systems.
                  This is why HP4 will be different.

         <h3>AAAAAAA!</h3>
         <p>
                  Body is shouting loudly.
                  And for good reason.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Rest of World, aka everyone I meet, care extremely little about hp-mark
                  in its current form.
                  It you're reading this blog post, you're among very few
                  (<a href="https://torbjornludvigsen.goatcounter.com/">source</a>).
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  As much as I crave attention, Rest of World craves brain tickle.

                  ... stimulating.
                  For me, a person who is constantly dying for attention, this is a problem.
                
         </p>
         <h3>What To Do</h3>
         <p>
                  Even at nanometer precision, hp-mark without a context would be nano-stimulating to the non-Hangprinter owning world.
                  Common solutions to this kind of problem:
                  
            <ol>
                       
               <li>Pay folks to suffer thruogh your under-stimulating thing. Attention-as-a-service. Day jobs. Ads. This is the most common solution
                  out in the wild.
               </li>
                       
               <li>Find people who love your stuff by unusual amounts.</li>
                       
               <li>Put your thing into an exciting context/story.</li>
                       
               <li>Pitch! Learn pitching dark arts.</li>
                       
               <li>Accept defeat.</li>
                     
            </ol>
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  All of these have their own pros and cons.
                  Too much to write down here.
                  I will do number 5 for the rest of this sprint, and then try my luck at number 3.

                  The first slightly more exciting context, at least for hp-mark, will be HP4.
                  End-to-end, released machine, with build manual and all.
                  I look forward to that.
                
         </p>
         <h3>Outlook</h3>
         <p>
                  HP4 is not very interesting on its own either though.
                  It will need it's own number 3 eventually.
                  A context creates a story.
                  Without a story, humans can not understand, or hardly even percieve your stuff.
                
         </p>
         <h3>Number 3 Suggestions for HP4</h3>
         <ul>
                  
            <li>
                       Hangprinting a body shaped house that's later sold as an art piece on a blockchain.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       A variable size telescope rod framed Hangprinter on wheels that collects its own raw material and can flip pancakes.
                       Perfect for Burning Man.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       Using HP4 as a motorized trampoline for cats. Computer vision detects cat. Ejects/bounces cat. Cat happy. The end.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       A Hangprinter v4 built... inside Minecraft. And then being sold as an NFT on a blockchain. Just add the blockchain
               to the end of every suggestion from here on.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       A Hangprinter with AI that registers its own company, and prints and assembles an array of other machines to be its
               employees.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       A Hangprinter that just connects deeply with people.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       Something simpler. A HP that puts cheese on a pizza and the slices it.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       Hangprinter doing something oddly satesfying, like cutting paper, or 3d printing ceramic poop. With glazing.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       A Hangprinter hanging down from space.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       A Hangprinter mounted upside-down. So D-anchor is on floor, ABC-anchors in ceiling, and print surface is in the ceiling.
                       Mounted sideways would also work, for hype purposes, but not very well in practice.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       A big Hangprinter outside using a hundred helium balloons as its D-anchor.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       A single, fat, vertical, constant speed extrusion. Preferrably made with the HP from space.
                     
            </li>

                       Printing a complete working bike in one go.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       A flexible motor driven suspended Hang-printbed. A <a href="https://gitlab.com/tobben/hangbed">hangbed</a>.
                     
            </li>
                  
            <li>
                       A HP that's just super huge, with ABC anchors mounted on big trucks, and D on a high crane.
                       This is the most frequently encountered one out in the wild, which more or less guarantees that it's a good one.
                       The word HUUUUGE by itself already tickles a bit. I'm sure you can feel it.

         <h3>Short End Note</h3>
         <p>
                  The old HP story is basically "a living thing that creates economic value".
                  Fully automated, self-replicating, printing furniture, taking zero space when not in use.
                  I'm not sure if that is tickly enough from my attention cravings' perspective.
                  Before it's even out there we'll never know.

                  I climbed down a rabbit hole recently.
                  Nearly half a year working on hp-mark.
                  The past 84 days even skipping blog post and newsletter writing.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Progress has been steady.
                  It works now.
                  <a href="https://gitlab.com/tobben/hp-mark">hp-mark</a> measures positions, like:

         <p>
                  Accuracy is not fantastic.
                  The image above is a lucky one, with only 3 mm of error.
                  A more commonly seen error is around 35 mm.

                  I chose C++, OpenCV, and a very traditional approach for this project.
                  I just wanted the most basic code that would mecanically find circles among pixels,
                  and then apply static geometric equations to transform circles into a nozzle position.
                  No AI stuff, no GPU stuff, no fancy hardware control, just
            $$
              f(x) \rightarrow y,
            $$
                 where \(x\) is an image, and \(y\) is a nozzle position.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Such an old and explored problem!
                  I felt confident.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Some things that took long for me to program, in descending order:
                  
            <ul>
                       
               <li><b>Good enough ellipse detection.</b> OpenCV's <code>SimpleBlobDetector</code> was ok, but ultimately not
                            robust enough for our purposes. I was lucky to find <a href="https://github.com/CihanTopal/ED_Lib">ED_Lib</a>, and spent a little over a month integrating it into hp-mark.
                            For example, I had to fight a little to get sub-pixel accuracy in the center and size data. More about that
                            <a href="https://github.com/CihanTopal/ED_Lib/issues/12">here</a>.
               </li>
                       
               <li><b>Geometry.</b> A photon bounces off a sphere, through a pinhole, and onto an image sensor. Many more follow.
                            They create a pattern, a projection, on the image sensor.
                            Given the position of the sphere, what's the equation of its projection? Or vice versa; given a projection,
                            what's the position of the sphere? Which projected point correspond to the sphere's center? I derived all relevant
                  equations by hand and wrote tests that wouldn't go
                            green before I was exactly right.
                            To bootstrap the chain of testable geometric functions, I derived the most basic equation in two different
                            ways, and tested that the two derived functions gave exactly the same results.
                            The system would never be good if the theory it rested upon wasn't sound, so I spent the time to make this
                            perfect.
               </li>
                       
               <li><b>Filtering among ellipses.</b> The improved ellipse detector found <i>lots</i> of ellipses.
                            Getting hp-mark to determine which ellipses represent real markers, was hard.
                            To  be real useful, hp-mark must be able to identify all its markers almost all the time,
                            so I spent extra time here as well. I will return to this point in the future, but we're at least finding
                            all the markers ca 80% of the time now.
               </li>
                       
               <li><b>Color recognition.</b> The human brain is full of heuristics that helps us determine color,
                            in a wide variety of situations. Very fine details of camera settings, light/shadow,
                            and way of definition, throws a simplistic computer program off very easily.
                            The strongest heuristic I was able to program, in which all colors are relative, still can not
                            identify a non-marker in a set of six real and one false marker.
                            Still, I was able to keep color as a marker categorizer that lets us
                            avoid having to put QR-codes on our markers.
                            I fought a bit for the aesthetics.

                  I feel like I'm almost too tired of it to even write about this stuff now.
                  But before I climb out of this rabbit hole,
                  I can show you something about how the ellipse detector works internally:

                       A single segment that forms a closed circle or ellipse will be detected already at this stage.
                       Most detectors can find complete closed-curve ellipses quickly and easily.
                       What sets ED_Lib apart is how hard it tries to piece together the chopped-up circles, and how quick and cheap
                       it manages to do this.

            <figcaption>... and these are the arcs.
                       (If you compare very closely with the segments image, you find that not all arcs match exactly.
                       They should match exactly.
                       I mixed up images from two different runs when preparing this, so this arc visualization is ever so slightly off.
                       It's still representative for the result below though, in that the top blue marker could not be found amog these arcs
               either, but all other markers were found.)

         <p>
                  In the image above, we see that one marker was missed, despise ED_Lib's many different heuristics.
                  I tried to tune the heuristics for the hp-mark use case.
                  See how that went, <a href="https://github.com/CihanTopal/ED_Lib/issues/13">here</a>.
                
         </p>
         <p>
                  Ultimately failing to tune the heuristics convinced me to put background plates below my markers.
                  That is what I'm currently working on.
                  They will probably end up looking something like this:
                
         </p>
         <figure>
                  <a href="./bilder/octagon.jpeg">
                       <img src="./bilder/octagon_liten.jpeg" alt="marker with bent octagonal background" width="500" height="500">

            <figcaption>Test of marker background with bent octagonal background.</figcaption>
                
         </figure>
         <p>
                  The final background design will probably be flat and circular, and hp-mark will use the edge of the
                  background, as well as the marker itself, to determine its position, further improving both robustness and accuracy
            of the system.

                  But not today.
                  I'm so tired of that kind of programming.
                  Let's celebrate the results at the top of this post for a while first.
                  And let's rest.
