    <p>
      I've tried to recruit early builders and investors lately.
      Results are quite few.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followers I don't know from before have spontaneously joined at a non-zero rate,
      but my campaigning towards previously known contacts has fallen all flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm rejected via ghosting.
      People are first enthusiastic, then they stop messaging me, and start avoiding me.
      Most of the time (9/10), it's even them who contacted me in the first place.
      I nudge them, I bribe them with money, I compliment them until they blush.
      But they don't come back.
      They continue to silently avoid Hangprinter, and any conversation about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm up to 10 ghosts in the past two months, and it's driving me insane.
      These pepole enthusiastically engaged in HP2 and HP3 usage and development.
      And now, I've worked crazy hours, invested €300 000, and solved fundamental issues that HP3 had.
      I've engineered away the hurdles that limited their HP2 and HP3 experience.
      Now the HP4 is ready.
      It's infinitely better than HP2 and HP3 were.
      It's beyond comparison, in the world, in history, and on the Internet.
      But now, all but the tiniest trickle of outside enthusiasm is gone.
      It's almost as if they liked the previous, worse machines, better.

    <h3>Reasons and Non-Reasons</h3>
    <p>
      Some of my ghosts have tried to explain themselves:
      "Not enough time", "Not enough space", "Not enough money", "Not enough documentation", "Not sure if it will work", "(Inaudible hand waiving)", "Maybe we if it gets feature X?", "Maybe you should try to be a Youtuber?".
    </p>
    <p>
      The first seven reasons apply to every technical project, and I struggle to extract information from them.
      Here is what I think, but don't dare to say, to my ghosts:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul style="font-size: 8px">
        <li>"Not enough time": You do. You really do. People have time to watch TV shows, climb mountains, and play silly farming games on Facebook. How do you somehow have time for other things? The "I don't have time"-thing is code for "I downprioritize that".</li>
        <li>"Not enough space": Same thing applies here. People who had space for HP3 have space for HP4 if they want to. People who really want Hangprinters suddenly find space for them, even in 10 sq m single room flats.</li>
        <li>"Not enough money": Some people don't. But millions do have money for other 3d printers. HP4 doesn't cost more. If you're interested in large scale 3d printing, you don't let a $1500 investment hold you back.
          Industrial manufacturing inevitably costs more than a pair of joggers. People know that, they're not stupid. Again, they just don't like HP4 enough to invest.</li>
        <li>"Not enough documentation": This is true. But it is said to the designer himself, who is offering personal consultation for free at any time. They have access to me, the source.
          They're standing in a river, complaining the water scoop is too small.
          But yes.
          The is never good enough documentation.
          I've designed HP4 to rely more on correct config (stock firmwares), and less on documentation.
          Building it with the current documentation is entirely doable.
          If you can put a screw into a table with a screw driver, successfuly place orders in online stores, and read ODrive's and Duet's documentation, then you can build a HP4.
          Some, who tried HP3 builds before, might don't believe me this time.
          But I've learned.
          Requirements and pain on users are much lower this time.
          And print results are much better.</li>
        <li>"Not sure if it will work": Why not? It will. And merely working sounds like a very low ambition.
          Your HP4 will work, and it will be a pleasure to use.
          Maybe I misunderstand what people mean with "work".
          Even people standing in front of a working Hangprinter will sometimes tell me that it doesn't work.
          Maybe they mean "Hangprinter v3 didn't work for me as I was expecting it to, last time I tried".
          They're probably right in that case.
          Some people did have disappointing experiences with HP3.
          That's why I refused to sell kits.
          So I've had people being angry at me for selling (the 7 HP3 kits I ever sold), and others being equally angry at me for not selling them kits.
          The play Internet is level very hard.
          I've improved the design a lot during the 4 years that have went by since the HP3 release. HP4 is better.</li>
        <li>"(Inaudible hand waiving)": I don't know how to respond to people's desperate hand waiving. I wave back. I know they're waiving because the thought of building a HP4 gives them some sort of discomfort in their tummy. If I had a cure, I would have given it to them. Maybe more proof is cure.</li>
        <li>"Maybe if it gets feature X?": Yes, I have thought about feature X, and decided not to add it.
          The HP4 is already crazy valuable, without feature X.
          Build a standard Hangprinter first, and make it work, before you try to add feature X yourself.
          Be humble.
          The Hangprinter Project has a problem:
          It attracts overly experimental and overly self-confident builders.
          They build home-brew downgraded versions of Hangprinter.
          They fail, and they have bad Hangprinter experiences, and burn out.
          Their hard earned knowledge is then lost from the community.
          Hangprinter is easy to build, but it's freakin' hard to improve.
          It's not impossible, but it's humbling.
          I'm not the easily outsmarted or naïve school boy some of you seem to think I am.
          I actually know things about Hangprinter, cable driven robots, and engineering in general.
          Both my HP4 design and my advice may sound cheap to you because I'm giving it to you for free, but they are not cheap.</li>
        <li>"Maybe you should try to be a Youtuber?": I don't want to be.
          If I can't get my machine out in your hands without also being a successful Youtuber, then we all loose.
          I don't understand. Very few of the designers, engineers, and inventors that I look up to, who have positively changed my life, have also been Youtubers.
          Would a big Youtube audience be required for me to deserve non-ghosting?
          I feel like that audience would go on to require even more things from me.
          I don't want my own show.
          I want my Hangprinter audience to want Hangprinter from me.
          I just want to design Hangprinter and get it in your hands.
          A second career just to make that happen is too much for me.
          Don't ghost little non-Youtuber me. Don't ghost anyone.
          And we're done.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Who are "They"? Why Do I Care About Them?</h3>
    <p>
      The people I'm talking about, both in open and closed development, are mainly sweet and thoroughly well intended individuals.
      I feel bad for making HP4, and my needs for it to spread, into their problem.
      I make Hangprinter to solve problems for them, not to make problems for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      People contact me to talk about HP4, and then turn silent.
      So I feel something is wrong,
      and I'm for the first time torn between open and closed source mentality and values systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closed source development provides some protection from feeling unseen because others aren't allowed to see your work, your flow, your code, your attempts and failures.
      So everyone in closed source is unseen, and nobody has to take it personal.
      In closed source, not seeing each other is considered a feature, not a bug.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no. Being open is kind of the whole point of the Hangprinter Project.
      These ghosting challenges I'm facing is just the good old core challenge of
      the Project coming back to me after years of hibernating deep down in technical work land.
      Designing a machine is easy. That is not the goal.
    </p>

      </a>
      <figcaption>HP4 again.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The goal is to get cable driven Repraps into people's hands.
      To design, but also to spread Hangprinter.
      Success is not one machine.
      Success is others desingning better machines, outsmarting me and leaving me behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, I'm still dragging you along.
      So far, HP4 is a dog trying to prove itself in a herd of really busy cats.
    </p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>
      Before I leave my pack of previously enthusiastic ghosts in the dust, I want to ask you some questions, to which answers would help me map the disconnect I feel was going on between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>When someone says "I will call you tomorrow", should the other person expect that to actually happen? Or does it simply mean "I right now am fond of the idea that I would potentially call you tomorrow, but the probability of that happening is still unknown"?
          Completely ok if it is, I just have to know. (PS! Please also teach me the code for "I will really call you tomorrow, for real". I do want a call from you, and my phone is on 24/7.)</li>
        <li>Do you know you make a difference to me? Or do you think you're too small or unimportant to affect me? Or am I too small or unimportant to bother about? Are both of us unimportant?
          What feels unimportant never gets done.
          If you are unimportant to yourself, then your life is chaos because nothing gets done, and you naturally don't get around to call me either.
          If one of us is unimportant to you, then I know the source of our disconnect.</li>
        <li>Do you think Hangprinter could improve someone's life, by being an economical way to manufacture? If not, how would you go about planning a great manufacturing innovation project?</li>
        <li>Do you find economic inequality or centralization to be problematic?</li>
        <li>For how long do you think cheap manufactured goods from overseas will be available to you? If "rest of my life", do you think it will also be available for the entirety of your children's lives?</li>
        <li>Can you think of an event that would stop the stream of cheap mass manufactured goods into your life?</li>
        <li>Many in our grandparent's generation have expressed that good manufacturing jobs were important to their lives. Do you think participating in manufacturing could make todays younger generations happier? In the short run, or long run?</li>
        <li>Do you think it's important for people to make art? Can you be happy without having art, or having some other sort of decoration around you?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Thought Experiment</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>How would you go about trying to help people live happier lives? Say you had lots of money and lots of time for this alturistic project. How would you start?</li>
        <li>Say you tasked someone <i>else</i> with helping people live happiers lives. You're the boss and tell the person what to do, and you have lots of money to pay the person. What would you make the person do?</li>
        <li>Now, say someone else had full freedom to go about helping others live happiers lives, and you're <i>not</i> their boss. But they ask you to make a wish. What would you wish from them?</li>
        <li>How do you make decisions in your life? Similar to how you make decisions in this thought experiment? Different? If yes, would you want to close the gap? What circumstance would help you do that, apart from wealth?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>How Do I Make Decisions In My Life? Guessing Your Answers, Trying To Map The Disconnect From Them</h3>
    <p>
      For most people, an important part of decision making is "I must make money".
      For a variety of reasons, mainly luck and circumstance, I don't feel like I have to make money.
      This creates a kind of weird outsider effect socially.
      It makes us experience different realities. People always ask me about money. Disconnect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another disconnect, when it comes to Hangprinter, is that I know every bit of it.
      I know how well the code is tested.
      I know how to source all parts, why they're chosen, where it's all published.
      I know it works, and how it will most likely develop in the future.
      I know what's real here and now, and what's possible right now:
      Revolution, growth, and freedom. Democratized large scale free form manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want that. Some people don't even want that. Some thrive in frames, and their solutions are always bigger frames. I'm happy for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would understand if you thought "he's talking about an unfinished design. Let's see if it works out first, and then we invest".
      I understand that you can get away with that in your own head.
      Maybe even feels safe for you to think like that.
      But if you feel such vauge skepticism, it closes your mind and prevents HP4 from working for you.
      Those of you who feel like you're "wait and see" are probably shooting yourself in the foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vauge skepticism is hard to connect to.
      It's chewing gum in your connector.
      It's not actionable, it's undisprovable, its game is closed for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet. The burden of evidence is on me, however vauge you might feel.
      I will convince you.
      Please don't ghost me.
      Please connect.
    </p>

    <h3>Ending This Ghostly Spiral Without Giving Up</h3>
    <p>
      Hangprinter is good. Hangprinter Works.
      This is not obvious, and it's not self evident.
      I have to defend that position.
      It is my job to educate you.
      Your minds will not spontanously change unless I make the case for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hangprinter previously didn't work, and now it works.
      Only I know that.
      Finishing my project has
      put me in a position where I feel weirdly in disagreement with you; my potential early builders and investors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of this spiral of ghosting and frustation begins with me using my machine successfully, showing that clearly, and then putting out humane documentation.
      Just limitlessly humane, endlessly helpful and patient.
      It's going to start with me. Again.
      And when it's out there for real, then I will not have time for you anymore.
      Sorry, sorry, sorry.

  <post id="personal_2" heading="Philosophy of Hangprinter" date="24-6-2021">
    <h3>The Software</h3>
    <p>
      People hate Software.<br />
      Bugs, leaks, errors.<br />
      Cryptic messages.<br />
      Work-arounds.<br />
      Menus, forms, and help-pages.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Software says "Ok, doing it".<br />
      And you wait, you don't know how long.<br />
      You don't know what it's doing.<br />
      You <i>need</i> it to work.<br />
      It sometimes fails. After a while.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the most under-funded government agency imaginable.<br />
      Broken windows, rotten apples, full trashcans everywhere.<br />
      People defend themselves.<br />
      Against software.<br />
    </p>
    <h3>The Plastic</h3>
    <p>
      People hate plastic.<br />
      Weak, cheap, poison.<br />
      Awful smell, cracking sounds, hysterical colors.<br />
      Short use.<br />
      Long trash.<br />
      Buries us, in lifeless artificiality.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever disease you get,<br />
      there's always a chance<br />
      that plastic,<br />
      disturbing your hormones<br />
      triggered it.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That's what people feel.<br />
      Plastic comes from an unknown place, underground.<br />
      Plastic poison can penetrate your skin.<br />
      Get into your body.<br />
      Like the devil.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      All other materials are natural.<br />
      Only plastic is not.<br />
      People defend themselves.<br />
      Against plastic.<br />
    </p>
    <h3>The Robots</h3>
    <p>
      People abhor most robots.<br />
      Plastic and software with motors.<br />
      Commanded by others.<br />
      In our surroundings.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The few robots that people love,<br />
      are exactly those<br />
      that they control,<br />
      themselves.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Other robots steal.<br />
      Grab attention.<br />
      Grab pictures, writings, and videos.<br />
      Robots intrude.<br />
      Take jobs.<br />
      Take lives.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Robots make money.<br />
      For the already rich.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Robots are<br />
      the ultimate source<br />
      of faceless power.<br />
    </p>
    <h3>The Future</h3>
    <p>
      A single person<br />
      with superior robots<br />
      could subjugate all other humans.<br />
      All you need is scale.<br />
      This risk was not in the past,<br />
      but is in the future.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of countries<br />
      or companies<br />
      or countries and companies<br />
      with superior robots<br />
      own the world.<br />
      That's the present.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      People must defend themselves.<br />
      Against robots.<br />
      And the only way<br />
      is with robots.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The power over yourself,<br />
      can stay yours in two ways:<br />
      through kindness of others,<br />
      who have robots,<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Or you can have robots yourself.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      People who hate software<br />
      who hate plastic<br />
      who have little money<br />
      will stumble into non-ownership of robots.<br />
      Through defending themselves<br />
      against software and plastic.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They must be given ownership,<br />
      or they will be owned.<br />
      Or worse:<br />
      Irrelevant.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They need free robots.<br />
      They need to be handed their free robots.<br />
      For free.<br />
      Extremely friendly robots.<br />
      Easy robots.<br />
      Entirely under their command robots.<br />
      But strong and valuable robots.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Robots that they will accept.<br />
      Robots that will eventually defend <i>them</i>.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But people hate robots.<br />
      And receive robots with stiff smiles.<br />
      Least wanted pair of socks, on Christmas Day.<br />
      Hangprinter is me, knitting socks.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I hate software and plastic.
      But I need Robots.
      And also you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just my kindness,<br />
      will not be enough to cover all,<br />
      when robots of power march in.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They will call it,<br />
      "economic realities",<br />
      and do what they want.<br />
      They will harm you only by accident.<br />
      Because they won't notice you at all.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you have robots.<br />
      A few for yourselves,<br />
      that you love.<br />
      Then you can step aside.<br />
      Not care about those in power.<br />
      And be free.<br />

    <p>
      I saw this
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EuWCFCgy58">talk</a>
      about one of my favourite artist's creative process.
      Here are a few quotes from it that I've resoned around the last few days:
    </p>
    <p>
      1: <i>"Publishing is not finishing. All the emotions are different. [...] Publishing is deciding to stop when you want to keep working. And it's super painful."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      2: <i>"Publishing works best if you think of it as a style of working. It's an attitude that persists throughout the entire creative process.
        Working to publish is about getting shit done. Your whole mentality shifts when you're working to publish. You focus on the stuff that matters,
        and you ignore the stuff that doesn't."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      3: <i>"Working to publish, it's selfless, it's outward focused, it's about results, and giving back, and contributing to the world."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      His shortest version of the good work to publish method is this:
    </p>
    <p>
      4: <i>"... doing only what matters, the whole time, and then stopping."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He explains that this is a great strategy because most ideas and attempts flop, and you don't know which will succeed beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      5: <i>"You can't choose what you're famous for. ... I can't make a song a hit.
        I can't control how my songs are pushed through the world and are experienced by others.
        What I can do is be prolific, I can be creative, I can make great stuff.
        What I can do is work to publish.
        You write the next scene, you record the next instrument, you build the next set, you shoot the next tape, you design the next synth,
        and I can </i>[publish all that]<i> and then I can move on, and I can go to sleep at night, knowing that I did everything I could."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to see if this musician's points can help me think better about where to take hp-mark and Hangprinter from here.
      His work is different from my work, but we're also similar.
      Let's see if we can make our experiences fit.
    </p>
    <h3>1: Publishing Is Not Finishing</h3>
    <p>
      Things are never finished, we have that in common.
      I like his emotion focused description.
    </p>
    <p>
      With where I'm at with hp-mark right now, I don't want to keep working.
      So we're not exactly at the same spot, the musician and I.
      That's because hp-mark is not like a song. It's more like an instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since even before starting to build hp-mark, I've thought of it as lifting Open Source Hardware over a threshold,
      closing the loop, ending the guessing game in open source hardware positioning.
      A short-term grind, a long-term investment for the common good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proprietary machines have had motion tracking for decades.
      Everyone knows an OSHW motion tracker could be made.
      It just requires someone's work hours.
      That might as well be me, I thought.
      But it's not very fun, no, and I knew that.
      It's painful to continue.
      It will be delightful to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hp-mark process changes after this month's demo, because hp-mark is good enough.
      I have improved both code and hardware a lot, and tested it thoroughly over the last month.
      It can take OSHW over the threshold just fine, if it reaches widely.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <h3>2: Working to Publish</h3>
    <p>
      The musician and I have different outputs and different metrics.
      For music, success is to reach people.
      hp-mark needs to
      <ul><li>reach people, and to</li><li>work well enough for them,</li></ul>to be successful.
      My pain comes from ignoring/failing at the former while working to my bones on the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the musician's point makes a lot of sense for hp-mark in the continuation.
      Just make a small thing and see if it flies.
      See if you can have a little success, quickly.
      I will get back to that way of working.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make something small work well enough, then try to reach people.
      Make something else work then try to reach people again.
      And again and again and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I regret not pasting a giant Aruco marker on the Hangprinter back in November 2020.
      I could also have dropped the spherical markers in December, when I found they were hard to make/source.
      And the colored markers stayed with me for too long also.
      I would have reached more collaborators and supporters by doing something simple,
      and then spent time reaching out instead.
      Imperfect decisions there. Well, well.
    </p>
    <h3>3 and 4 are Mostly the Same</h3>
    <p>
      I think quotes 3 and 4 mostly come down to the
      same improvement of process for hp-mark as quote 2 did:
      <ol>
        <li>Make a small thing.</li>
        <li>See if it flies.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>5: Torbjorn Tests New Things</h3>
    <p>
      I interpret quote 5 as "test new things, test different things, do the next thing".
      The last couple of Hangprinter years have felt a bit stagnant.
      Particularly on the outreach side of things. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Many worthwhile Hangprinter related projects are hard and time consuming.
      Robustness is not quick, easy, cheap, or sensational.
      We need robustness.
      So I had to dive into "doing it right", and swam across the swamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, I should have done it more
      quick, easy, cheap, and sensational than I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's always a light version of any project, one that breaks you down less.
      I must break down less. Economically and motivationally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick things to try:
      <ul>
        <li>Hangprinter with a very heavy effector</li>
        <li>Hangprinter with big heat bed</li>
        <li>Hangprinter with capable clay extruder</li>
        <li>Hangprinter with two tool heads mounted</li>
        <li>Hangprinter with as simple as possible tool changer</li>
        <li>hp-mark with a GIANT marker</li>
        <li>Outdoor Hangprinting</li>
        <li>Collaboration with 3d-printing artists</li>
        <li>Scripting auto calibration (easy now, after 7 months of grind :-P)</li>
        <li>Load cells along lines</li>
        <li>Store bought pellet extruder</li>
      </ul>
      Things that I don't yet know how to fit into the quick publish and outreach success template:
      <ul>
        <li>RepRapFirmware upgrade</li>
        <li>Electronics (Duet Wifi to Duet 3) upgrade</li>
        <li>Even more hp-mark precision and accuracy</li>
        <li>Hangprinter v4 official release with documentation</li>
        <li>More closed line guides, smaller bearings</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      The rabbit hole has gotten deeper.
      But progress is fast at this stage.
      Average error (that's accuracy) has shrunk from ca 35 mm to ca 3.5 mm.
      Maybe even smaller.
      I haven't tested accuracy thoroughly yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Precision (that's stability of repeated measurements) at the origin is down from ca 5 mm to ca 1 mm.
      And also:
    </p>
    <p>
      CHECK!<input type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled">Detect all markers on 95% of training images<br /></input>
    </p>
    <p>
      The markers have changed from small colored spheres to bigger retro-reflective disks.
      They're cheaper, lighter, easier to manufacture, and perform much, much better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to go and implement the disk geometric equations.
      My body protested for days when I picked up that task.
      Luckily, this time I had a
      <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-24672-5_41.pdf">research paper</a>
      to guide me through most of the theory,
      and I could quickly replicate my old test structure.
      This made me ca 10x faster compared to when I did the sphere geometry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've posted a couple of demos since last time:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <div class='embed-container'>
        <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9qjuZQowCE'

        </iframe>
      </div>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The first video shows the more fundamental use case for hp-mark: auto/assisted anchor calibration.
      It enables all other hp-mark use cases, including homing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So hp-mark is growing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extremely high recognition and identification rate I have now is thanks to some LEDs
      that I put around the camera:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="./bilder/POWERFUL.jpeg">
        <img src="./bilder/POWERFUL_liten.jpeg" alt="My Picam with led rings around it" width="500" height="253"/>
      </a>
      <figcaption>My picam v2 with two rings of in total 20 LEDs around it.
        This removes most problems I had with shadows disturbing measurements.
        I'd say it took identification rate from ca 95% to ca 99%(?).
        Out of ca 1000 test images, I haven't recorded a single identification failure yet.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      I know I could enhance accuracy and precision further by mounting these slightly higher end, low distortion lenses:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="./bilder/low_distortion_lenses.jpeg">
        <img src="./bilder/low_distortion_lenses_liten.jpeg" alt="A set of low distortion lenses" width="500" height="281"/>
      </a>
      <figcaption>A set of low distortion lenses that I ordered from Arducam.
        This setup would use the same image sensor, wire connection, and software interface as the current Picam v2.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      However, changing the camera PCB and lens means having to calibrate it and also make a new mounting bracket for it.
      Plus all the fiddling with wires, focusing the camera, unexpected stuff etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      My guess is 1-2 days of work.
      Is it worth it? What are my goals?
    </p>
    <h3>Keep Your Head Down And Work!</h3>
    <p>
      This sprint's goal is "high accuracy auto calibration".
      The higher level goal is "a reliable work horse".
      Peace of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The better camera achieves all of that.
      So I have to do it.
      Just like I redid the markers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't how I worked a few years back.
      This isn't how the HP1, HP2, HP3, and first prototype of HP4 were made.
      They were all just barely working systems.
      This is why HP4 will be different.
    </p>
    <h3>AAAAAAA!</h3>
    <p>
      Body is shouting loudly.
      And for good reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rest of World, aka everyone I meet, care extremely little about hp-mark
      in its current form.
      It you're reading this blog post, you're among very few
      (<a href="https://torbjornludvigsen.goatcounter.com/">source</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      As much as I crave attention, Rest of World craves brain tickle.
      Humans need this always.
      Brains want to light up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Current form hp-mark just isn't very...

    <p>
      ... stimulating.
      For me, a person who is constantly dying for attention, this is a problem.
    </p>

    <h3>What To Do</h3>
    <p>
      Even at nanometer precision, hp-mark without a context would be nano-stimulating to the non-Hangprinter owning world.
      Common solutions to this kind of problem:
      <ol>
        <li>Pay folks to suffer thruogh your under-stimulating thing. Attention-as-a-service. Day jobs. Ads. This is the most common solution out in the wild.</li>
        <li>Find people who love your stuff by unusual amounts.</li>
        <li>Put your thing into an exciting context/story.</li>
        <li>Pitch! Learn pitching dark arts.</li>
        <li>Accept defeat.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these have their own pros and cons.
      Too much to write down here.
      I will do number 5 for the rest of this sprint, and then try my luck at number 3.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      The first slightly more exciting context, at least for hp-mark, will be HP4.
      End-to-end, released machine, with build manual and all.
      I look forward to that.
    </p>
    <h3>Outlook</h3>
    <p>
      HP4 is not very interesting on its own either though.
      It will need it's own number 3 eventually.
      A context creates a story.
      Without a story, humans can not understand, or hardly even percieve your stuff.
    </p>
    <h3>Number 3 Suggestions for HP4</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Hangprinting a body shaped house that's later sold as an art piece on a blockchain.
      </li>
      <li>
        A variable size telescope rod framed Hangprinter on wheels that collects its own raw material and can flip pancakes.
        Perfect for Burning Man.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using HP4 as a motorized trampoline for cats. Computer vision detects cat. Ejects/bounces cat. Cat happy. The end.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Hangprinter v4 built... inside Minecraft. And then being sold as an NFT on a blockchain. Just add the blockchain to the end of every suggestion from here on.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Hangprinter with AI that registers its own company, and prints and assembles an array of other machines to be its employees.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Hangprinter that just connects deeply with people.
      </li>
      <li>
        Something simpler. A HP that puts cheese on a pizza and the slices it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hangprinter doing something oddly satesfying, like cutting paper, or 3d printing ceramic poop. With glazing.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Hangprinter hanging down from space.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Hangprinter mounted upside-down. So D-anchor is on floor, ABC-anchors in ceiling, and print surface is in the ceiling.
        Mounted sideways would also work, for hype purposes, but not very well in practice.
      </li>
      <li>
        A big Hangprinter outside using a hundred helium balloons as its D-anchor.
      </li>
      <li>
        A single, fat, vertical, constant speed extrusion. Preferrably made with the HP from space.
      </li>
      <li>
        Printing a complete working bike in one go.
      </li>
      <li>
        A flexible motor driven suspended Hang-printbed. A <a href="https://gitlab.com/tobben/hangbed">hangbed</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A HP that's just super huge, with ABC anchors mounted on big trucks, and D on a high crane.
        This is the most frequently encountered one out in the wild, which more or less guarantees that it's a good one.
        The word HUUUUGE by itself already tickles a bit. I'm sure you can feel it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Short End Note</h3>
    <p>
      The old HP story is basically "a living thing that creates economic value".
      Fully automated, self-replicating, printing furniture, taking zero space when not in use.
      I'm not sure if that is tickly enough from my attention cravings' perspective.
      Before it's even out there we'll never know.
    </p>
    <p>
      hp-mark does more than just exist now.
      It's getting quite good, but also quite lonely.

  </post>

  <post id="hangprinter_project_69" heading="hp-mark Exists Now" date="15-2-2021">
    <p>
      I climbed down a rabbit hole recently.
      Nearly half a year working on hp-mark.
      The past 84 days even skipping blog post and newsletter writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Progress has been steady.
      It works now.
      <a href="https://gitlab.com/tobben/hp-mark">hp-mark</a> measures positions, like:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="./bilder/result-217_0.png">
        <img src="./bilder/result-217_0_liten.png" alt="First ever non-zero result from hp-mark" width="500" height="376"/>

      <figcaption>Result 1: [-1.27, -217.65, 2.68]. Hand measured position is [0, -217, 0].</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Accuracy is not fantastic.
      The image above is a lucky one, with only 3 mm of error.
      A more commonly seen error is around 35 mm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lot of hp-mark work remains.
      I ticked 2 boxes, and added 6 new ones in the
      <a href="https://gitlab.com/tobben/hp-mark/-/blob/master/README.md#status">roadmap</a>
      today:

      I chose C++, OpenCV, and a very traditional approach for this project.
      I just wanted the most basic code that would mecanically find circles among pixels,
      and then apply static geometric equations to transform circles into a nozzle position.
      No AI stuff, no GPU stuff, no fancy hardware control, just
$$
  f(x) \rightarrow y,
$$
     where \(x\) is an image, and \(y\) is a nozzle position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such an old and explored problem!
      I felt confident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some things that took long for me to program, in descending order:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Good enough ellipse detection.</b> OpenCV's <code>SimpleBlobDetector</code> was ok, but ultimately not
          robust enough for our purposes. I was lucky to find <a href="https://github.com/CihanTopal/ED_Lib">ED_Lib</a>, and spent a little over a month integrating it into hp-mark.
          For example, I had to fight a little to get sub-pixel accuracy in the center and size data. More about that
          <a href="https://github.com/CihanTopal/ED_Lib/issues/12">here</a>.</li>
        <li><b>Geometry.</b> A photon bounces off a sphere, through a pinhole, and onto an image sensor. Many more follow.
          They create a pattern, a projection, on the image sensor.
          Given the position of the sphere, what's the equation of its projection? Or vice versa; given a projection,
          what's the position of the sphere? Which projected point correspond to the sphere's center? I derived all relevant equations by hand and wrote tests that wouldn't go
          green before I was exactly right.
          To bootstrap the chain of testable geometric functions, I derived the most basic equation in two different
          ways, and tested that the two derived functions gave exactly the same results.
          The system would never be good if the theory it rested upon wasn't sound, so I spent the time to make this
          perfect.</li>
        <li><b>Filtering among ellipses.</b> The improved ellipse detector found <i>lots</i> of ellipses.
          Getting hp-mark to determine which ellipses represent real markers, was hard.
          To  be real useful, hp-mark must be able to identify all its markers almost all the time,
          so I spent extra time here as well. I will return to this point in the future, but we're at least finding
          all the markers ca 80% of the time now.</li>
        <li><b>Color recognition.</b> The human brain is full of heuristics that helps us determine color,
          in a wide variety of situations. Very fine details of camera settings, light/shadow,
          and way of definition, throws a simplistic computer program off very easily.
          The strongest heuristic I was able to program, in which all colors are relative, still can not
          identify a non-marker in a set of six real and one false marker.
          Still, I was able to keep color as a marker categorizer that lets us
          avoid having to put QR-codes on our markers.
          I fought a bit for the aesthetics.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel like I'm almost too tired of it to even write about this stuff now.
      But before I climb out of this rabbit hole,
      I can show you something about how the ellipse detector works internally:

      <figcaption>The edge pixels are the grouped into segments. Each segment has a different color in this visualization.
        A single segment that forms a closed circle or ellipse will be detected already at this stage.
        Most detectors can find complete closed-curve ellipses quickly and easily.
        What sets ED_Lib apart is how hard it tries to piece together the chopped-up circles, and how quick and cheap
        it manages to do this.

      <figcaption>... and these are the arcs.
        (If you compare very closely with the segments image, you find that not all arcs match exactly.
        They should match exactly.
        I mixed up images from two different runs when preparing this, so this arc visualization is ever so slightly off.
        It's still representative for the result below though, in that the top blue marker could not be found amog these arcs either, but all other markers were found.)

    <p>
      In the image above, we see that one marker was missed, despise ED_Lib's many different heuristics.
      I tried to tune the heuristics for the hp-mark use case.
      See how that went, <a href="https://github.com/CihanTopal/ED_Lib/issues/13">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately failing to tune the heuristics convinced me to put background plates below my markers.
      That is what I'm currently working on.
      They will probably end up looking something like this:

      </a>
      <figcaption>Test of marker background with bent octagonal background.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The final background design will probably be flat and circular, and hp-mark will use the edge of the
      background, as well as the marker itself, to determine its position, further improving both robustness and accuracy of the system.

      But not today.
      I'm so tired of that kind of programming.
      Let's celebrate the restuls at the top of this post for a while first.
      And let's rest.
