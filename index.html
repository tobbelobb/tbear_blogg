  Optimize Chaotic Production
</h1>
<div class="date">29-6-2016</div>
<p>
  I presented my Master's recently, with a story line that was very RepRap centric.
  I'd like to re-present and develop my thoughts with some colors here.
  Be warned that this is a post about <i>why</i> I RepRap, not <i>how</i> I RepRap.
</p>
<p>
  I live in the EU and have a lot of contact with the US.
  I'm among the lucky ones by all metrics, but I also see a lot of frustration.
</p>

     Figure 2: Productivity and income since 1970. This plot shows data from USA but the trends are similar in all western countries.
     Output per work hour increased drastically between 1995 and 2010.
     Only the most positive economists see rising incomes after ca 1998.
     The productivity increase is largely attributed to better usage of computers, robots, and the Internet within organizations.

<p>
  The plots above tell so many stories I, could stare at them for hours.
  I see how the computer age takes off, and robots starts to produce stuff crazy fast while people go furious.
  It's like a very odd movie plot, it makes me scratch my head.
  I've experienced the frustrations of modern western life
    but I'm surprised by the glaring and obvious stagnation and frustration in the above stats.
</p>
<p>
  Computers are machines for thought work, they should lift our burden of thought and give us peace of mind.
  Well, at least in theory (my dreams)...
  It would be so nice to just reboot the computer revolution and make it better.
  Computers could make people independent, resilient, and proud if used right.
  Like cars do.

    Figure 3: The Ford Model T, released in 1908, made people love cars.
    Its central production was efficient and it used standard interchangeable parts.
    It was known for being easy to repair and modify.
    Kits that let people rebuild it into a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T#/media/File:Pullford_auto-to-tractor_conversion_advert_1918.png">tractors</a>,
      <a href="http://www.mtfca.com/discus/messages/331880/396676.html?1382724168">motor boats</a>, and other things were available.
    Almost 15 million copies were produced.

<p>
  Many are still inspired by T-Ford's successful production style.
  Bringing a machine to the masses has meant setting up a central production line for at least 100 years,
    including the years of the recent computer revolution.
  Only around 2007 was central production first rivaled, by copyability through self-manufacture.
  The RepRap 3D printers then got so easy to copy, partly thanks to self-manufacturing,
    that the number of producers grew exponentially.

    Figure 4: RepRap Mendel, released in 2009, made people love 3D printers.
    Its production was inefficient but easy to copy, and it used standard and self-manufactured parts.
    The self-manufacturing made it very easy to repair and modify, even without kits or other external help.
    Less than 1 million copies are produced so far.

<p>
  When rebooting the computer revolution we should try the new RepRap-style of production.
  In the thesis I show that RepRaps are very popular and numerous.
  I also show that they are actually produced and forwarded virally.
  To formalize this observation, I present some data collected by Spanish RepRappers (see Figure 5)
    and import a structural virality measure used by researchers on other viral phenomena.
</p>
<p>
  In the presentation I point out that chaotic production requires low <i>unique parts count</i>,
    good <i>documentation</i> and low <i>price</i>, just like assembly line production.
  I suggest that <i>software freedom</i> and <i>self-manufacture</i> are additional efficiency requirements not found
    in assembly line production.

    As far as I know, the person-centric graph in this figure is unique.

</figure>
<p>
  I set out to optimize the chaotic and distributed RepRap production
    and discover that I can do so by optimizing RepRap Assembly Workshops,
    and particularly the software that they use.
  I collect all the data I can find about RepRap Assembly Workshop arrangements on the Internet.
  See my data <a href="./bilder/Table_c1.pdf">in good looking pdf here</a> or in

</p>
<p>
  I end up packaging Marlin, Arduino IDE, Slic3r, Printrun and OpenSCAD in a live OS.
  Open Source Ecology tested the live OS for me, and they liked it quite well.
  I've also used it myself in a four-day 3D printing course for kids this summer,
    and I found it handy.

<p>
  I've been working on Open Source Ecology 3D printer workshops (see my <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Tobben_Log">work log</a> for exactly what I've been up to)
  the past month, and will continue to work on that until mid summer.
</p>
<p>
  Clerck would love to be developed further by anyone even if I'm on another project right now.
  The following instructions should not be considered "the ultimate way", it's simply how I did it on my first try with the prototype.
  The best absolute source of Clerck information is the OpenSCAD files in the Github repo.
  A special branch was created for this build manual, called
  <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/tree/build_maunal_0">build_maunal_0</a>.
  <code>Hangprinter.scad</code> is the most high-level entry point.
</p>
<p>
  This build manual will be short and terse.
  Ask questions
  <a href="forums.reprap.org/read.php?178,344022">the forum thread</a>
  to fill in knowledge and information gaps.

<h3>Step 0: Sourcing</h3>
<p>
  For vitamins bill of materials, see
  <a href="http://www.appropedia.org/Clerck,_a_RepRap_3D_printer_hanging_from_the_ceiling#Costs">the Appropedia article</a>.
  Some info on hardware specifics is found in
  <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/tree/build_maunal_0/used_hardware">used_hardware</a> directory in repo.
  For printed parts bill of materials, search
  <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/tree/build_maunal_0/stl">stl directory</a> of build_maunal_0 branch
  in Github repo for the shown STL files.
  You'll also need the Hangprinter-Marlin firmware.
  It's in the firmware folder of the
  <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/tree/build_maunal_0/firmware/Marlin">repo</a>.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Cut Lines to Length and Tie to Spools</h3>
<p>
  Cut all nine lines to desired lengths.
  If you know the distances between the origin (middle of print bed) and the mounting points (walls and ceiling),
    then you can use those to calculate good line lengths.
  I use twice the origin/wall-distance plus ca 1.5 meters along all axes.
  As there are 4 movement axes on this printer, there will be 4 lengths.
  We call them the A-length, B-length, C-length and D-length.
<p>
<figure>

     The bottom plate (largest printed part) has A, B, and C inscriptions on it,
       indicating which side should face which wall-mounted anchor point.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
  After this step you should have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 A-length lines</li>
  <li>2 B-length lines</li>
  <li>2 C-length lines</li>
  <li>3 D-length lines </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Tie the A-length lines onto one spool, then the B-length lines onto another spool etc.
</p>

     Lines will not be shown in subsequent illustrations.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Step 2: Assemble Spools and Gears</h3>

<figure>
  <a href="./bilder/assemble_individual_sandwich.png"><img
    src="./bilder/assemble_individual_sandwich_liten.png"
    alt=""></a>
   <figcaption>
    Use short (6mm?) M3 screws and nuts to assemble all four spools and large gears.
    Flatness of top or bottom surfaces of geared spools is important.
    Be sure that no screws or nuts protrude more than ca 0.5 mm.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Step 3: Sandwich Spools, Gears, Bearings and Spacers onto Bottom Plate</h3>
<figure>
  <a href="./bilder/stack_of_spools.png"><img
    src="./bilder/stack_of_spools_liten.png"
    alt=""></a>
  <figcaption>
    Exploded view of the stack of spools. From the bottom up:
    608 bearing, geared spool with D-line, spacer, 608 bearing, geared spool with C-line, spacer,
    608 bearing, geared spool with B-line, spacer, 608 bearing, geared spool with A-line.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The bearings and spacers should push-fit onto the middle cylinder of the bottom plate.
Ensure that geared spools rotate freely by rotating and wiggling them by hand.

<h3>Step 4: Mount Fish Rod Rings and Stop Screw</h3>
<figure>
  <a href="./bilder/fish_ring.png"><img
    src="./bilder/fish_ring_liten.png"
    alt=""></a>
   <figcaption>
     Single fish rod ring. The most protruding cylinder should be push fit into fish ring towers of bottom plate.

   <figcaption>
     The stopper screw and nut that can be used to lock the D-spool manually.
     Notice the nut trapped in the box.
     The stop screw works by pushing against the D-spool gear, preventing it from rotating.
     Use a nyloc nut in the box or remove the stop screw during printing, to avoid that the stop screw
     vibrates into a stopping position mid-print.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Step 5: Assemble the Tble-extruder</h3>
<p>
  I used the E3D Volcano as my hot end.
  Its build instructions are found
  <a href="http://wiki.e3d-online.com/wiki/E3D-v6_%28Volcano%29_Documentation">here</a>.
  You could use any hot end, but big nozzle diameter and long melt area are key for high print speeds.
  The Volcano has worked well for me
    in that it was easy to install, doesn't clog and drools surprisingly little compared to its big nozzle diameters.
</p>

<figure>
  <a href="./bilder/tble_assembly_step_1.png"><img
    src="./bilder/tble_assembly_step_1_liten.png"
    alt=""></a>
   <figcaption>
     Note the white PTFE (teflon) tube guiding filament into hot end.
     The blue 623 bearing needs support along the direction of the screw it's mounted on.
     I used ca 10 washers for this.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Be warned that the forthcoming alignment task fiddly.
  If I had any time to work on the Hangprinter project's modules,
    this extruder would be drastically changed to reduce fiddlyness.
</p>

<figure>
  <a href="./bilder/large_extruder_gear.png"><img
    src="./bilder/large_extruder_gear_liten.png"
    alt=""></a>
   <figcaption>
     The hex head screw is pushed through a sandwich of
       large extruder gear, printed part, 623 bearing, hobbed insert, 623 bearing, printed part and finally M3 nut.
     Some washers and lots of fiddling will be needed to assure feeding hobbs, support bearing and PTFE tube align with each other.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Step 6: Mount Extruder Motor</h3>
<p>
  The small extruder gear is push-fit onto the extruder motor shaft, which should have one flat side.
  Remove two neighbouring bottom screws from the bottom of the motor before mounting.
</p>
<figure>
  <a href="./bilder/mounted_extruder_motor.png"><img
    src="./bilder/mounted_extruder_motor_liten.png"
    alt=""></a>
   <figcaption>
     Align the two empty screw holes with the horizontal holes in the bottom plate.
     Most stepper motors are only threaded in their top piece,
       so the two leftmost screws in this figure need to be rather long.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Note that this step is very dependent on motor size (maybe unnecessarily so).
  If you have another motor than 17HS4401N,
    then double check that your motor fits (see lines 2, 3 and 4 in <code>measured_numbers.scad</code>).
  The extruder motor hole is created on
  <a href="https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter/blob/build_maunal_0/parts.scad#L262">line 262 in <code>parts.scad</code></a>,
  if you rather want to change the CAD file than change the motor.
</p>

<h3>Step 7: Mount Tble-extruder</h3>

<figure>
  <a href="./bilder/extruder_mount.png"><img
    src="./bilder/extruder_mount_liten.png"
    alt=""></a>
   <figcaption>
     Place extruder carefully so that gears roll easily, filament hole aligns with hobbed insert
     and edge is flush with extruder motor screw hole edge.
     Note that screws here are self-tapping.
     The distance between the bottom plate and the hobbed insert is a problem when changing filament, so
       some kind of guiding tube is recommended, but not yet designed...
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Step 8: Mount the A, B, C and D-motors</h3>
<figure>
  <a href="./bilder/motorerna.png"><img
    src="./bilder/motorerna_liten.png"
    alt=""></a>
  <figcaption>
    Motor gears are push-fit onto motor shafts. The motor shafts must have one flat side.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Match motor gear height and placement with corresponding spool.
</p>

    src="./bilder/mounted_motors_from_side_liten.png"
    alt=""></a>
   <figcaption>
     The A, B, C and D motors are mounted with three screws each.
     Note that you can rotate motors out of place easily by loosening two screws.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Step 9: Assemble Wall and Ceiling Parts</h3>

<figure>
  <a href="./bilder/ceiling_plate_with_bearings.png"><img
    src="./bilder/ceiling_plate_with_bearings_liten.png"
    alt=""></a>
   <figcaption>
     Let three vgroove 623 bearings hang from the ceiling plate.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  I hung a wooden platform in a lamp hook avoid having to drill screw holes in the ceiling (see
  <a href="./bilder/takfeste.JPG">picture</a>).
</p>
<figure>
  <a href="./bilder/wrapping_line.png"><img
    src="./bilder/wrapping_line_liten.png"
    alt=""></a>
   <figcaption>
     The wall plates have roller bearings attached to adjustment screws.
     Tread lines through loop holding roller bearing.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  The end of the A, B and C lines are attached to the M3 screw holding the corresponding fish line ring.
  More details on that in <a href="#ABC_frame_adjustment">a previous post</a>.
</p>


<h3>Step 10: Mount Wall and Ceiling Parts</h3>
<p>
  This is the step where you potentially do screw holes in your walls and ceiling.
  I use strong double-sided tape for all wall-mounted parts.
  Placement is really insensitive as long as all plates are, fixed and horizontal.
  Each side plate should be parallel with one side of the ceiling plate.
</p>

</figure>

<h3>Step 11: Thread D-lines</h3>
<p>
  I rested motors on two towers of books while doing this.
</p>

<figure>
  <a href="./bilder/thread_lines.png"><img
    src="./bilder/thread_lines_liten.png"
    alt=""></a>
   <figcaption>
     Let D-lines run clockwise around spool, thread through fish eyes, vgroove bearings near ceiling and tie to the screw head that holds
     the fish eye.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Step 12: Mount electronics</h3>
<p>
  Secure locking screw on D-spool-gear and flip the printer upside down.
  Mount Arduino Mega+RAMPS on an isolating plastic sheet, and mount that sheet using bottom-screws of stepper motors.
  I used a piece of ice cream packaging as isolation sheet.
</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Step 13: Upload Firmware</h3>
<p>
  Plug in the USB cable and upload the Marlin firmware found in <code>firmware/Marlin/Marlin</code>.
  If you haven't uploaded firmware through the Arduino IDE before, it looks like shown in
  <a href="https://youtu.be/YM3z9IdLzAk?t=1m">this video</a>.
  Try to communicate with your RAMPS board through USB cable and
  <a href="https://github.com/kliment/Printrun#using-pronterface">Pronterface</a> (no power supply is needed for this).
  Hangprinter-Marlin uses baud rate 115200.
  Unplug USB cable when done.
</p>

<h3>Step 14: Wire up electronics</h3>
<p>
  For those who are new to electronics, take some time to read about general electronics safety. For examle
  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/electronics-safety-rules.html">Electronics Safety Rules for Dummies</a> and
  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/169994/how-to-protect-your-pcs-hardware-from-static-electricity-when-working-on-it/">howtogeek article on static electricity protection</a>.
  Insulate the hot end. The Clerck design has a high risk of melting its own cables, which will
  cause fire (see <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?392,294850">forum thread</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Mount stepper driver chips and adjust Stepstick trimpots to get the right reference voltage
  (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bItYRMLGoVc">Tom's video on this</a> and
  <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/2133">Pololu's product home page</a>).
  I use Stepsticks with drv8825 drivers, extra long legs and cooling ribs both above and below chip
    (see <a href="http://vitana.se/opr3d/tbear/index.html#stutter">previous stuff</a>).
</p>
<p>
  If you connected power to RAMPS during reference voltage adjustment, pull the wall-plug and also unplug power connectors on RAMPS now.
  Also unplug your USB cable.
  Wire A-motor to RAMPS's X-contacts, B-motor to Y-contacts, C-motor to Z-contacts and D-motor to E1-contacts.
  Wire E-motor and hot end as shown <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS1.4#Wiring">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you want wirelessness, wire in the JY-MCY bluetooth antennae as described on <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Jy-mcu">the RepRapWiki</a>.
  Note that the antennae connection will prevent communication through USB cable as long as it is plugged in.
  I use Blueman Device Manager 1.23 and a Ubuntu 14.04 system for connecting to the JY-MCU.
</p>
<p>
  After doing safety-checks on the electronics and power supply with your multimeter,
  flip the printer back into upright position and couple the power chords to the RAMPS board.
  When you're confident that your wiring is right, plug your power supply into the wall and feed your Clerck its first taste of 12V.
</p>

<h3>Step 15: First Movement</h3>
<p>
  Connect to your Clerck through Pronterface and check that D-motor has a nice constant holding torque.
  Unscrew the D-stop screw and watch Clerck hang by itself.
  While holding a hand below it, try sending the gcode line <code>G3 D-1</code>.
  This tells Clerck to move 1 mm closer to the D anchor point in the ceiling,
    without recording or counting the movement anywhere.
  Also, ensure hot end temperature readings are sane and try to heat it to say 40 degrees Celsius.
</p>
<p>
  Did it move? Did temp level out at 40? Is it still alive? Sweet Victory!

  Now, don't disconnect and reconnect. RAMPS will reset upon reconnection and the D-motor will lose
  its static torque for a moment. This risks letting Clerck smash into the floor.
</p>
<p>
  The G3-command is very handy for manually homing the printer on startup.
  Clerck doesn't have automatic homing yet.

<h3>Step 16: Measure Lengths to Origin</h3>

     Where to measure to find the calibration value <code>ANCHOR_A_Y</code> of your Clerck setup.
     I find careful calibration measurements out in thin air to be the hardest part of a Clerck build.

<p>
  See lines 96 (<code>#define ANCHOR_A_X</code>) and onwards in <code>firmware/Marlin/Marlin/Configuration.h</code>.
  Measure lengths from fish eye to line opening in frame parts.
  Arduino IDE can be used to compile and upload Marlin.
  For experimentation with line length configurations, use gcode
  <code>M665 Q&lt;Ax&gt; W&lt;Ay&gt; E&lt;Az&gt; R&lt;Bx&gt; T&lt;By&gt; Y&lt;Bz&gt; U&lt;Cx&gt; I&lt;Cy&gt; O&lt;Cz&gt; P&lt;Dz&gt;</code>.

<h3>Step 17: Thread A, B and C Lines</h3>

     Your Clerck should now look roughly like this.

<h3>Step 18: Additions to Ceiling Plate</h3>
<h4>Counterweights</h4>
<p>
  I use ca 250 grams of counterweight attached in each corner, with lines running along the outermost D-lines and running through
  the same vgroove bearings in the ceiling part.
</p>
<h4>Manual Homing with Aiming Plumb</h4>
<p>
  I'm simply homing the printer using gcodes <code>G3</code> (move without recording it) after powering on.
  The gcodes <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Gcode#G92:_Set_Position">G92</a> and
  <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Gcode#M114:_Get_Current_Position">M114</a>.
  To help the manual homing process, I've attached an aiming plumb to the center of the ceiling part, see
  <a href="./bilder/center_lod.JPG">picture</a> and <a href="#hangprinter_project_18">previous post</a>.
