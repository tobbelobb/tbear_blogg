  A Little Work on Line Flex
</h1>
<div class="date">21-2-2018</div>
<p>
  Today's Hangprinter firmwares assumes no flex at all in the movement axes.
  This is obviously a very rough approximation.
  In reality, all Hangprinter axes act like springs.
  Accounting for this can win us several millimeters of accuracy near the limits of our reachable print volume.

<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>
  Some flex comes from line modulus, but adding infinitely stiff lines alone won't solve our problems because ceilings, floors, ceiling unit sheets and plastic parts also flex.
  Very stiff lines are also thick, building more on the spools and making the imperfection of our buildup compensation more severe.
</p>
<p>
  Another brute force solution would be to closely monitor the mover and constantly compute and execute ad-hoc compensation.
  This could be made to work well, but it would add to hardware cost and complexity.
</p>
<p>
  A third solution is to include flex in the firmware's internal model of the movement system.
  This keeps hardware simple.
  Configuration overhead must be minimized by using standardized parts and providing scripted and straight forward instructions.
</p>
<p>
  It would be possible completely circumvent configuration overhead by collecting flex data with force sensors.
  This would require extra hardware, which in turn would have to be configured.
  It is in the spirit of the Hangprinter Project to make hardware additions beyond the bare bones setup optional,
    and solve as much as possible in software.
</p>
<h3>Use The Force</h3>
<p>
  The scribbles below derive how to synchronize the four forces from the four motors,
    so that all lines can be tightened or slackened, without moving the mover.
  A force magnitude can be approximately mapped to a line shortening/elongation by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law">Hooke's law</a>,
    where a guessed or measured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young's_modulus#Calculation">Young's modulus</a> gives the spring constant \(k\).
  Note that the spring "constant" will vary with line length in our case.
</p>
<p>
  The no-flex line lengths that current firmwares calculate can be used to calculate a new line length that does (approximately) account for flex:
</p>
\begin{equation}
l_{acc} = l - F/k(l),
\end{equation}
<p>
  where \(l_{acc}\) is the new line length that accounts for flex, \(l\) is the line length calculated and used by current Hangprinter firmwares, \(k(l)\) is the spring constant of the suspended line, and \(F\) is the desired force to be exerted by the line.
  The four different forces \(F\) are called \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in the derivation/scribble notes below.
</p>

  </a>
  <figcaption>
    The mover is approximated to be a point mass.
    The six forces acting on the mover are drawn out in a beautiful hand made 3d visualization.
    It is not true that we <i>must</i> set one of \([ABCD]\) fixed.
    That is just one of many possible ways to constrain the system.
    Setting \(D=|\vec{D}|\) to be constant was just the most useful constraint I could come up with.
    Note that \(m\vec{a}\) will not be zero during a print, since the mover will be moving around.
    It is however easy to re-introduce into the calculations below, right beside \(m\vec{g}\) and \(\vec{D}\).

<p>
  Lots of divisions. Probably not simple enough to be done on a Atmel2560.
  So... What to do?
</p>
<p>
  As my professors always told me:
</p>
<p>
  "Taylor expand, my good boy.
  Taylor expand for the sake of glory and honor!
  Taylor expand, and use only the first two terms, because everything ... Yes! <i>EVERYTHING</i> worth fighting for can be approximated to be perfectly linear!
  I tell you, boy, if you ever ever feel doubt in your heart, just Taylor expand, and your problems will all be cake."
</p>
<p>
  Ok, they didn't quite say it like that, and maybe we should use three terms, but I'll save you the expansion for another post.
  If you're so excited right now that you want to Taylor expand yourself: do it around the origin, and remember that
</p>
$$
\begin{align}
  a_x &= \phantom{\text{ANCHOR_A_X}} - x,\\
  a_y &= \text{ANCHOR_A_Y} - y,\\
  a_z &= \text{ANCHOR_A_Z} - z,
\end{align}
$$
<p>
  where ANCHOR_A_X is non-existent by convention,
        ANCHOR_A_Y is the y-coordinate of your A-anchor,
        ANCHOR_A_Z is the z-coordinate of our A-anchor,
        and \((x, y, z)\) is the position of your mover relative to the origin.
</p>
<p>
  Also remember to handle the cases when denominators are zero in a graceful way.
  Fancy new 32-bit CPUs can probably compute the full expressions, but they can't handle division by zero.
</p>
<p>

  Consequences of Miscalibrating Anchor Positions
</h1>
<div class="date">28-1-2018</div>
<p>
  I made a script recently, to get learn how a Hangprinter axis with bad anchor positions behaves.
  The script itself is <a href="http://vitana.se/opr3d/tbear/scripts/calibration_errors.py">here</a>.
</p>
  <h4>The Quick Take-Away:</h4>
<p>
  Moving directly from/towards an anchor gives small errors, almost regardless of calibration errors.
</p>
  <h4>The Details:</h4>
<p>
  Four plots are shown below.
  Only the XY axes are shown, but the results are similar in three dimensions.
  Line length errors in different XY-positions are shown with color codes.
  They are normalized so that the error in the origin is 0 in all plots.
  In negative areas, the mis-calibrated axis will over-tighten.
  In positive areas, the mis-calibrated axis will let out too much line.
  Click the plots to get larger versions.
</p>
<figure>

  <img src="./bilder/anchor_config_at_ccw_angle_liten.png" alt="">
  </a>
  <figcaption>
    In this plot, the anchor is located at (-700, 700).
    The black arrow shows a measurement error of (-97, -97), so the machine has been configured with anchor locations (-797, 603).
    In the point (-500,0), this mis-calibrated axis will end up with 65 mm too short lines.
    In (0, 500) however, it ends up with 65 mm too long lines.

  New Extruder Holder Bracket

  I've converted the <code>extruder_holder</code> bracket to be ziptie based like the rest of the mover:

    Four slightly different extruder holders lined up for flex testing.

<p>
  The motor was possible to tilt downwards no matter how I changed the model it seemed.
  The winning tweak turned out to be adding a third ziptie first.
  Like this:

  Ziptie Mover
</h1>
<div class="date">3-1-2018</div>
<p>
  I've implemented Tom's suggestion to use zipties on the mover corners.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
  Using zipties in stead of screws has some advantages.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Works with beams of different widths (currently 12.5 to 17.5 mm). </li>
  <li>Does not rely on flexing fragile printed parts. </li>
  <li>Saves some weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also find it easier to assemble since there are no fiddling with small screws and nuts. </p>

  <img src="./bilder/Ziptie_mover_corner_2_liten.JPG" alt="">
  </a>
  <figcaption>
  Zipties of width 4 mm gives the most sturdy mover, but I've found sizes down to 2.4 mm (like in this picture) to work well.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  For wooden movers, I've also thrown away the old beam_clamp.
  It's both more sturdy and lighter to just clamp the crossbeam with a little M3 screw and nut.
</p>
<figure>
  <a href="./bilder/Beam_clamping.JPG">
  <img src="./bilder/Beam_clamping_liten.JPG" alt="">
  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Note that I pre-drilled 3.2 mm holes before inserting the M3 screw.
    I use washers on both sides of the hole because the pine wood is so soft.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  These two improvements combined save ca 60 g of weight compared to the previous mover.
</p>
<p>
  I've also added a little nutlock to beam_slider, to make it easier to tighten/untighten with one hand.
</p>

<div class="date">14-12-2016</div>
<p>
  The line compensation code may increase print volume noticeably.
  During testing, it has allowed Hangprinter version 2 to go places
  where version 1 surely would have over-tightened lines and skipped steps.

   Compensating Line Buildup on Spools
</h1>
<div class="date">11-12-2016</div>
<p>
  I've added to Hangprinter-Marlins some code that
  compensates for line buildup on the spools.
  Without it, I found that error in steps/mm grew to several percent
  as print dimensions grew close to 1 m.
  The problem was particularly noticeable on the D-axis since it has three doubled lines,
  so moving 1 mm in the D-direction puts 6 mm of line on the D-spool.

  Homing the Hangprinter Without Adding Hardware
</h1>
<div class="date">23-9-2016</div>
<p>
  I've thought some more about Hangprinter recently, since I'm going to demonstrate it on the
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1052788231502429/">3d printer festival</a>
  arranged by the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology in Oslo.
  I've only ever mounted and calibrated Hangprinter once before,
    so getting the manual homing to work fast enough worries me a bit.
  I don't have the time to implement the proposed
  <a href="http://www.appropedia.org/Clerck,_a_RepRap_3D_printer_hanging_from_the_ceiling#Home_position">accelerometer dependent homing procedure</a>

  Why Optimize Chaotic Production?

  RepRappers have noticed me that basing the story line of my

  This tickled me to think about and formulate why I do what I do, hence this post.

  Today I asked a <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?1,705311">question on reprap forums</a> that has puzzled me for a long time.
  Why don't we share gcode instead of 3d models?
  The technical obstacles are small and it would be an obvious optimization of chaotic production.
  See <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?1,705311">the forum post</a> for details.
