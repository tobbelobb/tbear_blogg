Awareness.
The knowing of how time is spent, why, and how it makes us feel.

Some webpage took 7 seconds to load.
Why? Maybe the server is slow, or overloaded, or maybe there’s some inefficiencies in some javascript code somewhere.
I lost concentration and felt slightly confused.

Working with low awareness makes you feel less alive when you work.
Not aware about yourself, you might unknowingly feel a bit crap when you work.
The crappy feeling sneaks into your work.
Makes it look grey, flat, and dead.

Being honestly aware helps you do something with those crappy feelings that actually works, like taking a break.
It helps good feelings spill into your work instead.
From there, it to spills into your bosses, customers, mentors, adepts, and colleagues.

## Hangprinter Way Forward

The most important thing is that you use it.
Play with it, find out what’s interesting about it, and make it yours.

Focus on crisp problems.
Ignore vague problems.

Below is my personal list.
Being hopelessly and constantly unfinished is the nature of our work.
Being aware of where we are, why, and how we feel about it, and sometimes even what to do about it, helps.
It helps to notice things.

## The List. It's supposed to cover every single annoyance in the Hangprinter Project. Big and Small.

Gitlab: CI doesn't run either tests, formatting, or tidy-scripts

Gitlab: New users get confusing emails about credit card verification and pipelines failing

Gitlab: Tobben is the sole contributor in all the repos

Discord: Things get lost within hours, and there's no system to extract and structure value from the Discord chat

Discord: We have no backup if it goes down

Print quality: Corners never get perfectly crisp, and I don't know exactly why. It might be ODrives with not perfectly stiff motors?

Motor bracket: It's fiddly to mount the encoder.

Motor bracket: The one side of the belt roller tower easily breaks.

Motor bracket: Must be printed in heat-resistant plastic.

Motor bracket: Getting the smooth 8mm rod to push fit with perfect resistance is a bit hard.

Motor bracket: Lines catch on to the belt too easily when slack/backwards rotation occurs.

Motor bracket: Max amount of line is too limited.

Spools and lines: The backing-trick described in the documentation need proper verification.

Lines, ceramic eyelets, bearings: We need better data on fraying. How much occurs? Where? How much is acceptable? Can we reduce it further?

Motor smoothness: Torque mode with anticogging is still not perfect for our use case. We want to cancel out rotational inertia of the motor, to prevent over-spin and "heavy feeling".

Startup issue: It's annoying to know that index search might fail upon power up. We want absolute encoders, or at least a guarantee that motors index search in the safe direction.

ODriveFirmware: It's annoying to be stuck on old firmware (0.5.1) because it makes the doc/v4 page look difficult.

Docs: Some of the features descibed in the HP4 Unique Features list (https://torbjornludvigsen.com/blog/#hangprinter_project_78) are not described in the doc/v4 page!

Line path, snail, line roller double: It feels like the 608 bearings introduce more friction and inertia than they have to. We could give them larger radii or change to smaller bearings.

Outreach: There are no professional-looking video presenting HP4 in a serious way. Users expect this to exist for a serious design.

hp-mark: Calibrating camera is hard and too much hassle.

hp-mark: is too slow.

hp-mark: Doesn't print warnings on result images.

hp-mark: is a bit hard to trust. Need another camera and a way to normalize results. Currently possible to take two measurements right after each other, with different result but both low reproj. error.

Force measurement: Measurements are imprecise. Vary by +-10N.

Force measurement: Needs to be integrated into auto-calibration-simulation-for-hangprinter. Will make autocal better.

hp-mark: should be able to measure positions of 6 markers relative to each other without requiring hand-measurements?

hp-mark: should write to its own camera config file when flag -c/--camera-calibration is supplied.

hp-mark: should be available from within ReprapFirmware.

Auto-homing: Currently doesn't exist. Is an important feature. Must be put together.

Outreach: we need a video of HP4 carrying a heavy extruder. It's written in multiple places that it's possible, but not yet demoed, so maybe still unconvincing.

Hexatrumpet: we need a render of a Hexatrumpet, to answer the "build volume shape?"-question better.

Outreach/funding: We need a deck of slides that presents HP4, it's unique features, and its potential.

Doc: There's currently documentation in too many places. hangprinter.org/doc should be the place for everything. Currently lots of important stuff is spread across READMEs.

Doc: It's a bit too hard to edit the various index.html files in the project. Simplify, particularly image and video inclusion (size scaling).

Openscad, Motor Bracket, snail: Many stls come out of Openscad non-manifold, and need manual repair. That's a huge waste of time.

Mesh Compensation, Forward Kinematics: It seemed like I needed to increase the values manually to make it compensate sufficiently?

Cable Connections: We need to learn how to more securely connect cables, and teach this in the BOM and doc/v4.

Full scale structured testing: None exists.
