            I'm a sucker for gamification.
            Prospects of badges and points is a huge motivator for me.
            People can now see that I have the "Running Like a Lunatic"-badge on a social fitness platform,
            and that I have more points than them because of it.
            Feels great.
            Definitely worth it.

            I always wish work was as rewarding.
            Work that feels rewarding gets done so easily and even feels better afterwards.
