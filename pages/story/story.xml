      and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a>
      technology as a way to speed up technical development and make it more available for common people.
      He has therefore published all his work under open source licences since the begining and built a community around it, see

      In recent years he has started using his own modern technology to create artwork that he loves.
      As a sailor growing up at the coast, he takes inspiration from the sea.
      "I want to make things that I want in my own home, and things that I want to give as a gift to my loved ones", he says.
