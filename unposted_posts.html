<h4> The back end </h4>
<p>
  The whole web app is written in Common Lisp with a custom made wrapper to Neo4j as it's back end.
  That means it uses a graph data base to store its information, which I think is awesome.
  It means filtering becomes the easy part.

  Practical applications of 3d-printing at home

<div class="date">16-1-2014</div>
<p>
  I recently walked around in the house, trying to find missing plastic
  parts that I could replace. What I found was a missing wheel on a dimmer
  and a missing knob on a mixer tap.

<h1>
  Rescueing a half finished print
</h1>
<div class="date">19-1-2014</div>
<p>
  I was recently faced with a problem I've met several times before: mid print,
  the USB connection broke down and the printer stopped
  (I should have used an SD-card).
  This time I decided not to give the print up, but find the last printed line
  in the gcode, reload from there and finish the print.
