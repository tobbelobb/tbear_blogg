<h4> The back end </h4>
<p>
  The whole web app is written in Common Lisp with a custom made wrapper to Neo4j as it's back end.
  That means it uses a graph data base to store its information, which I think is awesome.
  It means filtering becomes the easy part.

  I recently walked around in the house, trying to find missing plastic
  parts that I could replace. What I found was a missing wheel on a dimmer
  and a missing knob on a mixer tap.

<h1>
  Sourcing a Reprappro Mendel in Larvik. Day 1
</h1>
<div class="date">16-1-2014</div>
<p>
  Last summer holidays, I decided I wanted to build a Reprap to my parents to see how useful
  it could be to them as non-computer-wizards with little experience of the idea of
  3d-printing. To make it a little more interesting, I decided to use printed
  parts from my Printrbot+, <a href="http://vitana.se/opr3d/doku.php?id=skrivare:sigrid">sigrid</a>,
  and to buy the vitamins one at a time, preferrably in Larvik. 
  It would be a nice test of how available these Reprap parts really are (or of
  how good Larvik is as a hardware shopping city...).
  For BOM and all other information, I used
  the build-instructions from reprappfo.com. 
  I got to work immediately and ordered
  a heatbed:
</p>

<p>
  I also ordered a borosilicate (heat resistant glass) plate:

<p>
  All the M8 threaded rods + nuts were bought in the local hardware store Biltema
  for 913 NOK. We could have saved 360 NOK by choosing galvanized steel instead
  of stainless, but dad thinks stainless looks better. Cutting the right lengths
  were done with dads grinder.

  Sourcing a Reprappro Mendel in Larvik. Day 2 and 3
</h1>
<div class="date">18-1-2014</div>
<p>
  Bought a bunch of screws and searched the whole town for seven 623-bearings.
  I only found three of them, and they were ecessively expensive (nearly 100 NOK each!).
  Screws of size M2.5 weren't available either.
  Nobody in the harware and electronics shops knew what an XLR-socket was, so I 
  ended up buying on of a wrong type. Linear bearings of the type LM8UU were also
  impossible to find. One shop could order really expensive ones if I gave them
  the exact measures, but I declined. Couldn't find smooth 8 mm rods either. 
  Conclusion:
  The parts needed to build a Reprappro Mendel are not readily available nor
  cheap i the city of Larvik.

<p>
  Four of the printed parts split in half beacause of a weak layer 
  (had some problems with the extruder when I was printing them). 
  They were easily glued toghether with two-component epoxy though.
  Enough hardship for today. 
  One thing actually went really well. I managed to involve Dad when mounting
  together the skeleton:

  </figure>
<p>
  I think involving him in the build greatly increases the chances of him wanting
  to test it when it's operational.
</p>
<p>
  I also had a failed attempt to buy a Prusa Nozzle, which I would really like
  to try out. They were sold out. It's nice to see business going well for
  Reprap open hardware producers. There's lots of interesting hot ends out there,
  but to save time and effort I decided to go for a standard Reprappro
  hot end kit from Emakershop this time.

</h1>
<div class="date">18-1-2014</div>
<p>
  Today was a better shopping day. A local hardware store cut me the smooth rods
  I needed for 25 NOK. "And that gives us huge margins", was the owners comment
  on the price, so I guess smooth rods are really cheap when you buy in large
  quantities. If I had a garage, I would try to do that.

<p>
  Since Larvik couldn't deliver all the small stuff I needed, I turned to good
  old ebay for belts, linear bearings, M2.5 screws, XLR-contacts and stepper motors:

<p>
  Sluggo helped by making a little 
  <a href="http://vitana.se/opr3d/doku.php?id=komponenter:stegmotorer:17hs8401">wiki</a>
  to store all the important specs (in Swedish).

  Sourcing a Reprappro Mendel in Larvik. Day 5
</h1>
<div class="date">18-1-2014</div>
<p>
  For the z-axis, I had chosen M6 instead of M5, because I had a pair of M6 lying
  around. Making them, and their nuts fit into the printed x-motor-bracked and
  x-idler-bracket was a PITA, involving lots of difficult sanding. Even getting
  the M3 nuts down into the nut traps was really difficult and time consuming
  because of the small holes and overall low quality of my printed parts.
</p>

  properly before printing them would have saved so much time.</figcaption>  
  </figure>
<p>
  Eventually, I had x-brackets with nuts fit super-tight which is nice.

<p>
  Finally, I got 623 bearings (1.7 NOK each!) from ebay, and Igus clip bearings
  and a hobbed bolt for the Mini extruder from eMakershop. I'm quite surprised that
  Igus clip bearings are used. They are pretty hard to find, even on the internet,
  and they seem easy to replace with a home made alternative. I would definitely
  replace them with printed nylon bushings in my own design.

  Sourcing a Reprappro Mendel in Larvik. Day 6 and 7
</h1>
<div class="date">19-1-2014</div>

  Not much could be done day 6. Managed to make an insulating sheet with a handsaw
  and a drill from the dxf on Reprappro's Mendel repo on Github:

  At day 7 dad came home from work with an old aluminum traffic sign! I cut it out to
  a heat spreader (except the corner holes).

  use them to hold up the insulator + heat spreader:

  Sourcing a Reprappro Mendel in Larvik. Weekend 1 and 2
</h1>
<div class="date">19-1-2014</div>
<p>
  At this point, my summer job in Oslo had started, so I could only work
  during weekends. Pace naturally slowed down. This gave the postal service time
  to catch up. I received endstop switches, glass bed, 623-bearings, hot-end,
  XLR-plug, stepper motors, the Melzi board and filament. Unfortunately, the filament I received had the wrong
  diameter, so the order must be placed again... Ordering is hard and depends on
  a lot of unknown factors.

<p>
  Since I used a M6 rod for the z-axis, and the motor shaft had 5 mm shafts, I
  couldn't use a uniform tube as linkage. The solution I found was to drill
  out a couple of glue gun patrons. I described them in an 
  <a href="#ggp">earlier post</a>.

<h1>
  Sourcing a Reprappro Mendel in Larvik. The rest
</h1>
<div class="date">19-1-2014</div>
<p>
  To actually make the finishing touch to make the Mendel operative was much
  more difficult than expected. Troubles with electronics took most of the extra
  time. The 
  <a href="http://vitana.se/opr3d/doku.php?id=komponenter:kretskort:melzi_ardentissimo">Melzi</a>
  I had found cheap on ebay had the wrong sort of connectors
  (not screw connectors), and an Atmega 644p instead of an Atmega 1284p.
  The standard Melzi stepper drivers, A4988, also requires active cooling for currents
  greater than 1 A. 
</p>
<p>
  For reasons I still don't understand, we could only control
  the motors to turn if we
  sat velocities really low. Maybe Marlin and Pronterface disagreed on whether to
  use absolute or relative coordinates, causing the movements sent from pronterface
  to be interpreted as impossibly fast (due to voltage rise times etc) by Marlin?
  In the end, one of the A4988's and the heat bed transistor burned because of
  too high motor current a frayed untinned HB connection respectively). 
  I decided to buy a completely new
  Melzi from a new source (reprap.me), to tin all connectors and to only use motor 
  currents less than 1 A.
</p>
  <figure>

    src="./bilder/saaSvaartOchSaaFel_liten.JPG" 
    alt="Cheap Melzi"></a>
  <figcaption>The cheap Melzi, before it burned.</figcaption>  
  </figure>
<p>
  The new Melzi board had two problems though:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Z-homing didn't work</li>
    <li>Extruder motor just stuttered</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  The z-homing problem looked like 
  <a href="http://youtu.be/eveQZXUCM1Q">this</a> (youtube video).
  Issuing M119 (Get Endstop Status) showed that Marlin thought the z-switch was
  always open. It was solved with a kamikaze soldering directly on the Atmega's one
  leg. It is described in an 
  <a href="#kamikaze">earlier post</a> and in this
  <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?4,238556">forum thread</a>.
  The extruder motor was luckily a problem i software. The solution is described
  in this
  <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?1,232675">forum thread</a>.
  <br><br>
  These troubles ceirtanly slowed the project down, and only one day was left
  of my summer holydays to teach my parents how to use the machine. The first
  print was a handle to a dipstick. It printed 
  nicely like <a href="http://youtu.be/y6LerqXlAQg">this</a> (youtube video). And
  we soon went on to print a Julia vase (desperate attempt to convince Mum this
  machine is of any value:

<p>
  After a couple of weeks into the semester, Dad mentioned on the phone 
  wanted to try it out to print a smartphone case. I went on Thingiverse and
  found the
  <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:131532">Monogrammed iPhone case</a>
  made by TheNewHobbyist. I modified it, sliced it, emailed the gcode 
  and got this picture from Dad a couple of days later:

<h1>
  Cadding support structures when PLA printing
</h1>
<div class="date">19-1-2014</div>
<p>
  I recently had to print out some small overhangs with PLA. After a previous
  <a href="#disaster">PLA support material experiment</a>, I decided to try
  to model the support structures myself (i was inspired by one of nophead
  wonderful blog <a href="http://hydraraptor.blogspot.se/2012/08/peel-able-support.html">Peel-able support?</a>. 
  In OpenSCAD, it looked like this:
</p>
  <figure>
  <a href="./bilder/y-end-back.png"><img

  <a href="https://github.com/smartfriendz/smartrap">Smartrap repo</a> with
  my added supporting blocks in red and green.</figcaption>  
  </figure> 
<p>
  I found that ca 0.15 mm vertical gap gave the best results with my current
  plastic and slic3r settings. This will of course vary wildly depending
  on plastic type, geometry, layer height, extrusion width and so on.
  I found the results satisfying:
</p>

  I will definitely CAD my own support material again, when only PLA is
  available as print material.

  Minor Reprappro Mendel tweaks
</h1>
<div class="date">19-1-2014</div>
<p>
  I was recently preparing some large prints with my parent's Reprappro Mendel,
  and decided to do a bunch of minor tweaks. First, I went to Reprappros own
  documentation to search for inspiration, and they had prepared
  <a href="http://www.reprappro.com/documentation/RepRapPro_Tricolour_improvements">this</a>
  =D. I decided to to both the "Fan mount":
</p>

    alt="Fan mounted on Reprappro Mendel"></a>

  and the "Alternative positions for extruders":

    src="./bilder/extruder_pos_liten.JPG" 
    alt="Alternative extruder pos Reprappro Mendel"></a>
  <figcaption>The alternative extruder position of choice on my parent's Reprappro Mendel.
  This gave ca 2 cm extra print height and was done in 15 minutes. No software settings
  needed to be changed, no wires needed to be disconnected. Using only two
  mounting points is definitely rigid enough.</figcaption>  
  </figure>
<p>
  I haven't found any elegant way to tension the y-belt on this design easily.
  At least I found a way that doesn't consume a lot of time or concentration,
  the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:38970">belt tensioner</a>
  by Reuben on Thingiverse. This is how it looked

  I was recently faced with a problem I've met several times before: mid print,
